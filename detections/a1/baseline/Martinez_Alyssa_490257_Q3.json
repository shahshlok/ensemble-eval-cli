          "conceptual_gap": "There is no conceptual gap here, as the student's method of using `nextDouble()` twice to read `x1` and then `y1` from a single line of space-separated input is perfectly correct and standard practice in Java. The code successfully reads `x1` and `y1`, then prompts for `x2` and `y2` and reads them correctly. The calculation logic is also sound, following the formula precisely. The student's implementation is correct.",
