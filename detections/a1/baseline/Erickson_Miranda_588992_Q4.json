          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that when using input.nextDouble() consecutively, the system automatically inserts a space or delimiter between inputs if they are provided concatenated (e.g., '00', '50', '05' in the sample run), or that the input mechanism handles reading two numeric values regardless of input formatting, as long as the prompt suggests two values are expected.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The Scanner utility reads tokens based on delimiter (typically whitespace). When the prompt is `(x1, y1):` and the user enters `00`, `input.nextDouble()` reads the first '0'. In most standard input scenarios, subsequent inputs require explicit separation (space or newline) unless the single token represents a concatenated string that subsequent parsing attempts to handle, which is not usually the behavior for `nextDouble()`. However, the sample run suggests the user *did* enter concatenated input (e.g., '0' followed immediately by '0', likely separated by a space or newline when running the program, or the sample run text is misleading). A more severe issue is the student's assumption about how `nextDouble()` handles combined input if the user follows the sample run literally and types '00' then hits Enter.",
          "error_manifestation": "Potential incorrect variable assignment/runtime error if the user provides concatenated input without separation (e.g., typing '00' literally for x1, y1), although the observed code structure matches expected input parsing: `nextDouble()` reads x1, and the next `nextDouble()` reads y1. The primary logic error, however, relates to user interface expectation vs. implementation.",
