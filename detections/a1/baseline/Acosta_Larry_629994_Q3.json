Therefore, the sum `sum_sq` is mathematically guaranteed to be non-negative (unless extreme edge cases of overflow/underflow or NaN propagation occur, which are not relevant here). The explicit check `if (sum_sq >= 0)` is redundant, indicating a flawed mental model where internal arithmetic results are treated as potentially invalid or untrustworthy, much like external user input.",

The sum of two squared real numbers (dx_squared + dy_squared) is always non-negative by definition in mathematics.

The conditional check is logically redundant and suggests the student doesn't fully understand that Math.sqrt() will never receive a negative value from this computation. Additionally, if sum_sq were negative (which is impossible here), the code would silently fail by leaving distance_result as 0.0 instead of handling the error properly.",

The student appears to think that explicit conditionals are needed around input operations, even though 'if (true)' always executes and serves no logical purpose.
