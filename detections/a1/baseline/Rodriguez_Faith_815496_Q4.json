          "conceptual_gap": "The student correctly uses `nextDouble()` to read coordinates, but provides only three prompts for six required inputs. Specifically, line 7 reads `a` (x1) and line 8 immediately reads `b` (y1) without a second prompt for y1. This pattern repeats for (x2, y2) and (x3, y3). If the user follows the sample input (e.g., enters '0 0 5 0 0 5' all on one line), the code works because `nextDouble()` blocks only when there are no available tokens, not because the prompts are correctly structured.",

          "conceptual_gap": "While using `nextDouble()` twice consecutively works if the user provides space-separated input ('0 0'), the provided sample run shows input '00' on a single line, which is problematic. Crucially, the student fails to consider the necessary separation between the prompts for logically grouped inputs (like x1, y1) which should ideally be prompted individually or requested with clear spacing/formatting expectations for the user. More fundamentally, the student's implementation of reading two values consecutively without explicit prompts for the second value makes the input procedure unintuitive and fragile compared to typical interactive I/O design.",

If the user enters '00' as shown in the example prompt, `x.nextDouble()` might read '0' then fail to read the second '0' correctly (though in this specific sample run of '00', it's likely reading 0.0 twice if the input is processed digit by digit or if the user enters '0' and then '0' immediately). More generally, the lack of separate prompts severely impacts usability and robustness.",
