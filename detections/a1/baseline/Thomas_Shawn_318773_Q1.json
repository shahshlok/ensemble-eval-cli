If the `hasNextDouble()` check fails, the program should silently skip reading that value and proceed using the variable's initial default value (0.0), thereby preventing a runtime error and ensuring program completion regardless of missing or malformed input.",
          "conceptual_gap": "For sequential, mandatory inputs, the program should assume or enforce successful reads or utilize exception handling/loops for robust recovery. By using isolated `if` checks, the student treats the three required input variables ($v_0, v_1, t$) as independent, optional inputs. If the user fails to provide one or more inputs, the corresponding variable retains its default value (0.0), leading to an incorrect result (e.g., if $v_1$ fails, acceleration is calculated based on $v_1=0.0$) without informing the user about the missing data.",

This suggests a misunderstanding that Java requires this extra step or that there's a semantic difference between reading directly into a variable versus reading into a temporary first.

While not incorrect, this pattern indicates confusion about variable assignment and input handling.",
