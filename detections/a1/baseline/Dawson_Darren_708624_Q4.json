          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that printing prompts like `(x1, y1):` that require two input values (x and y) guarantees that the `nextDouble()` calls will correctly read the two input values associated with that single prompt, regardless of how the user formats the input in single line, relying on visual cues rather than Scanner behavior.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The conceptual gap is the misunderstanding of how `Scanner.nextDouble()` processes input tokens. When the prompt `(x1, y1):` is printed twice for subsequent calls to `nextDouble()`, if a user enters both inputs on the same line (e.g., `0 0\n`), the first `nextDouble()` reads `0`, and the second `nextDouble()` immediately reads the second `0` from the same line (assuming whitespace separation), without waiting for a new prompt to be printed for the second variable. The code prints prompts for two variables but only truly waits for external input once for the block of two `nextDouble()` calls if the user provides the input sequence quickly.",
          "error_manifestation": "Wrong input association/Poor user experience. While it works if the user enters inputs like `0 0` on one line or `0` then ENTER then `0` then ENTER, the prompt layout suggests two values for one point, yet the code prompts for the first value, then immediately reads the second value without a reinforcing prompt.",
