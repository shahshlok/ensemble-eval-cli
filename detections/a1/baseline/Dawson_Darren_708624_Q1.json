          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that calculating `a = v1 - v0` and then dividing by `t` in separate steps is equivalent to implementing the formula a = (v1 - v0) / t, without recognizing that the intermediate variable `a` only holds the numerator, not the complete acceleration value.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student has correctly identified that acceleration requires dividing the change in velocity by time, but has failed to recognize that assigning `a = v1 - v0` creates a temporary variable that only represents part of the formula. While the final calculation `averageAcceleration = a / t` does produce the correct result mathematically, this reveals a potential misunderstanding: the student may not fully grasp that `a` at line 8 is not the acceleration itself, only the velocity change. The code works correctly by accident, but the naming and structure suggest the student conflated the intermediate velocity change with acceleration.",
