          "conceptual_gap": "When reading mandatory input from the console in a procedural program, unless explicit error handling or robust looping is implemented, relying on `if (s.hasNextX())` makes the input conditional. If input is missing (e.g., EOF reached) or invalid, the conditional assignment is skipped, and the variables (x, y, x2, y2) retain their initialized default value (0.0). This results in a silent logical error (wrong calculation) instead of the program correctly waiting for input or raising an expected exception/error when parsing fails.",

          "conceptual_gap": "The student fails to understand how the `Scanner` consumes tokens. `s.hasNextDouble()` checks if the *next* token is a double. If multiple `hasNextDouble()` calls are made sequentially without ensuring the user has provided enough distinct tokens, subsequent `nextDouble()` calls will likely fail to execute because the conditional check evaluates to `false` after the first one or two successful reads from the prompt line. If the user provides tokens on the same line (e.g., '1 3.5'), only two tokens are immediately available. The remaining conditional reads (lines 10, 14, 15) will wait for more input or fail prematurely, leading to incorrect variable assignment (variables retaining their default value of 0.0) if the waiting behavior is not triggered correctly, or if only two values were provided per prompt line.",
          "error_manifestation": "Wrong output or incorrect data assignment. In the provided sample run, reading x1 and y1 on lines 9 and 10 might consume '1' and '3.5', respectively. When the second prompt appears, if the user enters '2.1 4.5', the subsequent reads for x2 (line 14) and y2 (line 15) using the conditional checks will work as intended if the user provides 4 distinct tokens in total across two lines. However, the pattern suggests the student thinks the conditional check is necessary for execution, leading to overly complex and potentially brittle input handling.",
