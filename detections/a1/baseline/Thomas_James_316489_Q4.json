          "conceptual_gap": "The student's mental model does not account for how the Scanner class interprets whitespace and line breaks. When the user enters '0 0' (as shown in the sample run where the input appears to be '00', '50', '05'), the Scanner will parse these as separate tokens regardless of whether they're on the same line or different lines. However, the sample run format suggests the user enters two space-separated values per prompt. The code correctly handles this, but the student may have misunderstood the input format expectation. More critically, the sample run shows '00', '50', '05' which appear to be malformed inputs\u2014these should be interpreted as '0 0', '5 0', '0 5' but the notation is ambiguous. The code itself handles proper numeric input correctly with nextDouble().",

          "conceptual_gap": "The student implemented input reading by calling `x.nextDouble()` twice on the same line (e.g., `double x1=x.nextDouble(),y1=x.nextDouble();`) immediately after a single prompt. While structurally correct, this design relies on the user entering two values delimited by a space or newline on the same line, contrary to the prompt's implied format (e.g., `(x1, y1):00` which typically means reading two digits '0' and '0' consecutively if the user types '0' then '0'). The sample run shows combined input '00', '50', '05'. If the user types '00' without a space/delimiter, only the first `nextDouble()` reads the entire '00' (value 0.0), and the second `nextDouble()` waits for a new input, or if the user intends '0' and '0', they must input '0 0'. The student's code relies on the input mechanism providing two distinct numerical tokens immediately following the prompt.",
