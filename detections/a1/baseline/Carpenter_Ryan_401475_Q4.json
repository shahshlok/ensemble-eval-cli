          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that a single call to input.nextDouble() reads both coordinates (x and y) when prompted to enter two values on a single line, or that the Scanner automatically handles combined input like '00' by splitting it into '0' and '0' for two consecutive calls.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, input.nextDouble() reads the next token that can be parsed as a double. If the user enters '00' and presses Enter, that is treated as a single token '00' (value 0.0), satisfying the first nextDouble() call. The second nextDouble() call waits for new input, causing the program flow to halt or consume unexpected subsequent input if the user enters subsequent coordinates immediately.",
          "error_manifestation": "Wrong output or input reading deadlock/confusion if the user enters coordinates without proper spacing, as suggested by the sample run '00', '50', '05'. If the user enters '0 0' then '5 0', etc., the code executes correctly, but the input prompt formatting indicates the student misunderstands how Scanner handles adjacent numbers without delimiters.",
