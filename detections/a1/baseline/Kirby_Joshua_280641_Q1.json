          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that using if-statements with hasNextDouble() checks is a sufficient way to handle input validation, and that initializing variables to 0.0 as defaults is an acceptable fallback when input is missing.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student has conflated input validation with error handling. While the code checks if doubles are available, it silently accepts missing or malformed input by using default values (0.0). This means if the user enters fewer than 3 numbers, the program will still run with incomplete/default data rather than explicitly requesting re-entry or reporting an error. Additionally, the initialization of acceleration to 0.0 before checking if t != 0.0 masks the division-by-zero protection\u2014if t is 0, the output will be 0.0, which is incorrect rather than an error message.",
          "error_manifestation": "Wrong output: If a user enters fewer than 3 values, the program silently uses 0.0 for missing inputs, producing incorrect calculations. For example, entering only '3' would result in v0=3, v1=0.0, t=0.0, and acceleration=0.0, which is incorrect.",
