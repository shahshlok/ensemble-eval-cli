          "student_thought_process": "The student assumes that when using `Scanner.nextDouble()` twice in succession immediately following a prompt, the user will input two separate numbers separated by whitespace (or hitting enter between them), and that this behavior is correctly prompted by the single print statement, 'System.out.print(\"(x1, y1):\");'.",
          "conceptual_gap": "While the code is technically correct for reading two doubles, the prompt `(x1, y1):` strongly implies a specific input format (like '0, 0' or '0 0') but only a single `System.out.print` precedes the reading of *two* values. The student has a flawed mental model regarding the necessary I/O interaction flow, failing to realize that reading multiple values requires either careful user input formatting or explicit separate prompts for better usability and instruction. In the sample run provided in the problem description, the student's code relies on the user entering '00', '50', and '05', which, if entered without whitespace and immediately followed by Enter, might be parsed oddly depending on the `Scanner` implementation details, or if the user indeed enters '0' then '0' (separated by space or Enter). The code is functional but demonstrates poor I/O design, suggesting a lack of consideration for the user experience when consuming multiple tokens per prompt.",
