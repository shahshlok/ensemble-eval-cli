          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that when reading multiple values with `nextDouble()`, the first value read is assigned to the first variable name encountered in the code, regardless of what that variable is semantically intended to represent. The student thinks `y=x.nextDouble()` reads x1, and `n=x.nextDouble()` reads y1, based purely on the order of assignment statements.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student has confused the semantic meaning of variable names with the order of input reading. In Java, `nextDouble()` reads input values sequentially in the order they are called. The variable name (y, n, a, b) has no bearing on which input value is assigned to it. The student needed to understand that they should assign the first input to `x1`, the second to `y1`, the third to `x2`, and the fourth to `y2` - but instead they assigned them to arbitrary variables (y, n, a, b) without tracking the mapping correctly.",
          "error_manifestation": "Wrong output. The program will compute an incorrect distance because the coordinate values are mapped to the wrong variables. For the sample input (1, 3.5, 2.1, 4.5), the program computes distance using (x1=1, y1=3.5, x2=2.1, y2=4.5) but assigns them as (y=1, n=3.5, a=2.1, b=4.5), then calculates c=(2.1-1)=1.1 and d=(4.5-3.5)=1.0, resulting in sqrt(1.1\u00b2+1.0\u00b2)=sqrt(2.21)\u22481.486, which happens to match the expected output by coincidence. However, the variable naming is semantically incorrect and suggests a misunderstanding.",
