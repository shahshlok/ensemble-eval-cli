They assume prompts and required input tokens are strictly synchronized line-by-line.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student fails to account for the difference between a non-blocking output (System.out.print) and blocking input (Scanner.nextDouble()). If the user only provides the first coordinate (x1) and presses Enter, the `y1=x.nextDouble();` call blocks. However, the subsequent prompt for 'x2, y2' is printed immediately (line 10) before `y1` receives its input, meaning input intended by the user for the `(x2, y2)` coordinate set may be consumed by `y1`, leading to corrupted variable assignment and confusing user experience.",
