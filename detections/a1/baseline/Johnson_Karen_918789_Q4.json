Similarly, the input to the square root in the distance formula (`dx^2 + dy^2`) is inherently non-negative because it is a sum of squares. The student is overly cautious about potential negative inputs for `Math.sqrt` where the application of basic geometry/algebra ensures otherwise, indicating a potential misunderstanding of when defensive coding is necessary, or an incorrect belief that geometric/algebraic calculations can yield mathematically impossible temporary results requiring manual runtime checks.",
