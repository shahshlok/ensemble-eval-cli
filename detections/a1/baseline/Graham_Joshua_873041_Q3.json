This necessitates an explicit check (`if (sumOfSquaredDifferencesValue >= 0.0)`) before calculating the square root to prevent potential unexpected results (like NaN).",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student lacks full confidence in the mathematical guarantees provided by Java's primitive arithmetic operations. Since `sumOfSquaredDifferencesValue` is computed as the sum of two squared `double` values, it is mathematically guaranteed to be non-negative. The compiler/JVM adheres to these basic arithmetic properties for standard real numbers (excluding bizarre inputs like operations involving NaN, which are not relevant here). The inclusion of the check and the accompanying comment ('nervous about edge cases, even though it should not be') suggests a foundational lack of trust in the deterministic reliability of basic variable state and arithmetic.",
