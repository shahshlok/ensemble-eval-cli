          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that when the denominator (t) is zero, the calculation should be skipped, and the physical result should be reported as $0.0$, or that $0.0$ is the safe default value to avoid a runtime error when dividing floating-point numbers by zero.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java's floating-point arithmetic (IEEE 754), dividing a non-zero number by $0.0$ does not throw an exception but correctly results in `Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY` or `Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY`. By initializing acceleration to $0.0$ and skipping the calculation when $t=0$, the student handles a case that would mathematically yield an infinite result (assuming $v_1 \\ne v_0$) by forcing the output to $0.0$, which is logically incorrect for acceleration calculation. This demonstrates an incomplete understanding of how floating-point division by zero is handled versus integer division by zero.",

          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that division by zero in Java requires an explicit runtime check before performing the division. They think that without this check, the program will crash or fail to produce output, so they added a conditional guard to prevent division when t equals 0.0.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student has misunderstood the problem requirements and Java's handling of division by zero. The problem statement implicitly assumes valid input where t is non-zero (as shown in the sample run). More importantly, in Java, dividing by 0.0 produces Infinity (not an exception or program crash), so the defensive check is based on a false premise about what happens at runtime. The student is treating this as a potential error condition that must be handled, when the problem expects straightforward calculation without validation.",
          "error_manifestation": "Wrong output: When t=0, the program outputs 'The average acceleration is 0.0' instead of calculating the actual result (Infinity or following the formula strictly).
