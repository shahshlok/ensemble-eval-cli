          "conceptual_gap": "In Java programming for problems requiring specific inputs, skipping the input and substituting a default value (0) instead of throwing an error or re-prompting fundamentally corrupts the program's logic and calculation.

Standard practice would use `s.nextDouble()` which waits (blocks) until the required token is provided or throws an exception upon failure, confirming that the token is mandatory.",

If it is false (e.g., EOF or insufficient tokens provided in the initial input buffer), the associated `s.nextDouble()` call (which is what the student intended) is skipped, leaving the variable at its default initialized value (0.0).
