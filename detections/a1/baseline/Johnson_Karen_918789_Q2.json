          "conceptual_gap": "In Java (and in logic generally), a boolean expression of the form `(p != 0) || (p == 0)` is a tautology: for any numeric value `p`, one of these must be true. This means the `if` statement will always execute its body, so it provides no protection or special handling at all. The student appears to treat `if` as a kind of ceremonial guard around the computation, rather than as a precise logical test that must distinguish between different states. They may not fully understand that logical operators (`||`, `&&`) follow formal boolean algebra rules and that combining mutually exclusive conditions with `||` produces an always-true condition.",

This reveals a gap in understanding how boolean logic works and how conditions control execution.
