          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that when using `Scanner.nextDouble()` twice in a row, the input system is robust enough to handle the user specifying both values immediately on the same line (e.g., '00' for x1 and y1) without careful separation, or that the scanner implicitly consumes whitespace or expected delimiters correctly when reading a primitive like double sequentially.",
          "conceptual_gap": "While `Scanner.nextDouble()` skips leading whitespace and reads the next token as a double, if a user enters two numbers without separation (e.g., '00' from the sample run), the scanner perceives this as a single token unless the input format dictates otherwise (which it doesn't when reading raw primitives). The sample input `00` for (x1, y1) means the first `nextDouble()` reads `0.0`, and the second `nextDouble()` attempts to read the rest of the stream, which is likely just a newline/whitespace depending on how the input buffer was handled, leading to an `InputMismatchException` or incorrect parsing depending on the exact implementation/platform environment.",
          "error_manifestation": "Runtime error (`InputMismatchException` or `NoSuchElementException`) or incorrect parsing resulting in strange behavior, especially if the user follows the exact format `00` without spaces, as suggested by the sample output run's input lines.",
