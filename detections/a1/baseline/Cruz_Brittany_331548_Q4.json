          "conceptual_gap": "Java's `Scanner.nextInt()` tokenizes the input stream based on delimiters, typically whitespace. If a user enters '00' followed by a newline, the Scanner treats '00' as a single token representing the integer 0. The first `nextInt()` consumes this single token. The second `nextInt()` then blocks execution indefinitely, waiting for a second token, causing the program flow to halt before printing the next prompt.",
          "error_manifestation": "Program blocks indefinitely (hangs) during input processing because the second call to `nextInt()` does not find a necessary delimiter (whitespace/newline) to separate the inputs if they are entered contiguously, deviating from expected control flow.",

          "conceptual_gap": "The `Scanner.nextInt()` method reads the next token that can be parsed as an integer, based on whitespace delimiters (space, tab, newline) by default. If the user enters '00' in response to a prompt expecting two integers, the first `nextInt()` reads '00' as the integer 0 (assuming leading zeros are ignored, which is typical for integer parsing, but if the user meant two separate single-digit inputs like '0' and '0' separated by space, they must provide the space). In the provided sample run, the input `00` is consumed entirely by the first `nextInt()` (for `x1InputValue`), causing the second `nextInt()` (for `y1InputValue`) to block waiting for more input or fail if the standard input buffer stream is exhausted and '00' was the only input line provided.",
          "error_manifestation": "Interactive input failure/mismatch. The program will either consume '00' as a single integer (0) for the first variable (x1) and then wait indefinitely for the input of the second variable (y1) on the same line, or it will eventually throw an `InputMismatchException` or similar error if the input stream is structured unexpectedly, depending on how the user enters the remaining input when prompted for two values.",
