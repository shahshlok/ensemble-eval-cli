This means the if-statement provides no protection or branching at all; it is equivalent to having no if-statement and always executing the body. The code still produces the correct output for the problem because the intended logic is simply `holder_cost = gallons_needed * price_per_gallon;`, but the presence of this condition reveals a misunderstanding of how logical operators work and what an if-statement is for.",
