          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that when the sample input shows '00', '50', '05', these represent single coordinate values that can be read sequentially with nextInt(). The student does not recognize that '00' is actually two separate inputs: x1=0 and y1=0, not a single two-digit number.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student misunderstood the sample run format. The notation '(x1, y1):00' means the user enters x1 and y1 as separate integer inputs on the same line (or logically as a pair), but the code reads them correctly with two consecutive nextInt() calls. However, the sample output suggests the inputs should be interpreted as: x1=0, y1=0, x2=5, y2=0, x3=0, y3=5. The student's code structure is actually correct for reading two integers per coordinate pair, so this is not a misconception in the code itself.",
          "error_manifestation": "The code actually reads input correctly. However, upon closer inspection, the logic is sound - the code properly calculates three sides using the distance formula and applies Heron's formula correctly.",

The student views these as four distinct values rather than recognizing the formula structure.",
          "conceptual_gap": "While this isn't technically wrong (the math still works out correctly), it suggests the student may not fully understand that they're computing four factors that all need to be multiplied together in Heron's formula: \u221a[s(s-side1)(s-side2)(s-side3)]. The use of intermediate variables a, b, c, d is unnecessary but functionally correct. This is more of a style issue than a conceptual misconception, so confidence is very low.",

          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that printing a prompt and reading input sequentially (e.g., `(x1, y1):`) will necessarily separate the reading of two integers, such that the first `input.nextInt()` reads the first number provided by the user, and the second `input.nextInt()` waits for a completely separate, second line or prompt response, regardless of how the user formats the input.",
          "conceptual_gap": "When using `input.nextInt()` (or similar token-based reading methods in `Scanner`), the method reads the next contiguous integer token from the input buffer. If the user enters '00' on the command line for the prompt `(x1, y1):`, the Java program attempts to parse '0' as `x1` and then immediately parses the second '0' (the next token) as `y1`, without waiting for further input or a separator if the user failed to provide one (like a space or newline). If a user provides input exactly matching the sample run (e.g., entering '00', pressing Enter, then entering '50', etc.), the code incorrectly consumes digits meant for different variables and potentially different prompts.",
