          "conceptual_gap": "In Java (and in boolean logic generally), `A || B` is true if *either* side is true. For any double value `x`, exactly one of `x != 0.0` or `x == 0.0` is always true, so `x != 0.0 || x == 0.0` is a tautology that is *always* true and therefore does not guard or distinguish any case. The student seems to lack a clear mental model of how boolean expressions are evaluated and how conditionals control execution. Conceptually, they are using an `if` as if it performs some generic 'validation step' just by mentioning all possibilities, rather than understanding that the expression must be selectively true/false to change control flow. For this particular problem, this does not change the final result (the cost is computed correctly whenever `mpg != 0.0`), but it reveals a misunderstanding of how logical operators and conditionals work in Java.",
