          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that printing a prompt and reading two doubles in sequence will automatically handle combined user input like '00', or that the `nextDouble()` calls implicitly skip necessary delimiters (like spaces or newlines) without requiring distinct input streams (like `0 0`).",
          "conceptual_gap": "When using `scanner.nextDouble()` repeatedly without reading any separating tokens (like `nextLine()`), the Scanner waits for the necessary numerical input. If the sample run implies inputs are provided as '00', '50', '05' without spaces separating the coordinates for a single point, the student's current code, which expects two distinct numerical inputs per point, will consume the input stream incorrectly based on how the user enters data. Specifically, reading two doubles from a single line requires either spaces (e.g., '0 0') or separate lines. The sample run output formatting ('00', '50', '05') strongly suggests the user is mimicking a poorly formatted single prompt response per line, but the code structure demands two separate numeric inputs per prompt and may fail if the user enters '00' intending it as 'x=0, y=0'. The code expects '0' followed by '0' (separated by whitespace or enter). This is a common flaw where students conflate console input structure with code structure.",
          "error_manifestation": "Logical error leading to potential runtime issues or incorrect data assignment if the user inputs coordinates without whitespace separation, or if they input '00' expecting two values, but the Scanner reads '0' then waits for the second '0' separately.",
