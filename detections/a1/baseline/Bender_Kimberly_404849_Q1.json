Furthermore, the student assumes that avoiding division by zero is the only necessary safeguard, regardless of the numerical stability or the logical validity of the 0.0 result.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The purpose of error handling is often to either prevent undefined behavior (like division by zero) or to provide meaningful feedback/alternative logic for invalid inputs. While the code successfully prevents the `ArithmeticException`, assigning `0.0` when `t=0` does not solve the underlying problem of invalid input; it merely substitutes one invalid result with another predetermined value without indicating an error to the user or implementing proper branching/re-prompting logic that industrial programming often requires.",
