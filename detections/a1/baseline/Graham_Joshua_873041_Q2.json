They treat multiplying by zero as something that might need to be prevented, not as a perfectly valid operation that simply yields 0.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java (and in arithmetic generally), multiplying by zero is always well-defined and safe: x * 0.0 simply evaluates to 0.0 with no error. Only division by zero is problematic, and even then, for doubles Java yields Infinity/NaN rather than throwing an exception. By adding a zero-check before multiplication and conditioning the computation on pricePerGallonInDollars != 0.0, the student reveals a mental model where any use of zero in a computation might need to be specially handled, rather than understanding that only specific operations (like division) are exceptional cases. The program still produces correct results for this task, but the unnecessary guard indicates confusion about when Java will actually have runtime issues.",

          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, dividing a finite non-zero floating-point number by $0.0$ results in `Infinity` or `-Infinity`, and $0.0 / 0.0$ results in `NaN` (Not a Number). These results do not cause the program to crash or throw an exception (like integer division by zero does). Furthermore, the cost calculation logically requires the fuel economy (MPG) to calculate gallons needed, and the price (PricePerGallon) to calculate the final cost. Preemptively calculating one result (`gallonsOfFuelNeeded`) or the other (`totalDrivingCostInDollars`) to be $0.0$ based on a zero check when the zero values propagate correctly through the floating-point arithmetic pipeline is redundant and potentially obscures simpler code. Especially checking for `pricePerGallonInDollars != 0.0` (Lines 34-37) is entirely unnecessary because multiplying by zero yields zero, which is the mathematically correct result if the price were genuinely zero.",
