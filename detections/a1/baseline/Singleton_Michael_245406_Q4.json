          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that when reading multiple `double` values sequentially using `input.nextDouble()` after a prompt, the input must be provided on separate lines or separated by a system-specific delimiter (like a space or newline) regardless of how the sample run shows adjacent input (e.g., '00').",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student has assumed that the input mechanism requires waiting for separate inputs, but they failed to account for how the `nextDouble()` method parses concatenated numbers like '00', '50', or '05' when processed by the `Scanner`. In reality, when the sample input '00' is provided, the first `nextDouble()` reads '00' (which is 0.0), and the second `nextDouble()` waits for new input, causing the program to hang or require additional input lines, contrary to the fast input shown in the sample run.",
          "error_manifestation": "Requires user to input numbers separated by spaces or newlines instead of directly mimicking the concatenated input style shown in the sample run. The sample run input format ('00', '50', '05') implies the user is expected to enter two numbers consecutively without separation, which `input.nextDouble()` cannot handle correctly without a space/newline delimiter, or the student misinterpreted the sample run's input format itself.",

          "conceptual_gap": "If the student intends for the user to enter two numbers immediately adjacent to each other (e.g., typing `00` for 0 and 0), `input.nextDouble()` will consume the entire '00' as a single number (0.0 for x1), and the second `input.nextDouble()` call (for y1) will wait for more input. To handle two inputs on one line without separators, a custom parsing approach or specialized input utilities would be needed, but the current implementation requires standard token separation (space or newline). The discrepancy suggests the student did not correctly model how `nextDouble()` tokenizes input versus how the sample output shows input being provided.",
          "error_manifestation": "Wrong sequence of input reads; the program executes differently or requires differently formatted user input than implied by the sample run structure, leading to confusion or incorrect assignment of coordinates if the user attempts to mimic the format without spacing.",
