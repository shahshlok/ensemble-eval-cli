          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that dividing by zero in this context must be actively prevented in Java (even with double values), so they add a guard to avoid division and arbitrarily return 0.0 when time is zero, treating this as a safer or more correct behavior than performing the division.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, dividing integers by zero throws an ArithmeticException, but dividing doubles by zero does not crash the program; it produces Infinity, -Infinity, or NaN according to IEEE 754 rules. The student appears to conflate integer and floating-point division semantics and therefore adds a defensive check that silently turns an undefined/invalid physical case (t == 0) into a valid numeric result (0.0). This hides the fact that the inputs are invalid rather than reflecting the mathematical or physical reality, and suggests a fuzzy understanding of how Java actually executes double division by zero.",
          "error_manifestation": "Wrong output in the edge case t == 0 (the program reports an acceleration of 0.0 instead of signaling an invalid input or reflecting Infinity/undefined behavior).",
