          "conceptual_gap": "The student has not properly understood operator precedence and expression evaluation in the context of the physics formula. While the code does technically compute the correct result (due to left-to-right evaluation and proper precedence), the student's mental model suggests they may not fully grasp that the formula a = (v1 - v0) / t requires the numerator to be computed before division. The actual code works correctly, but the decomposition into `a = v1 - v0` followed by `averageAcceleration = a / t` suggests the student may have misunderstood the formula structure itself.",
