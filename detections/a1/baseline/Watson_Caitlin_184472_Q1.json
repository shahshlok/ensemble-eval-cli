          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that arithmetic operations must be broken down into explicit sequential assignment steps, storing every intermediate value (including values already held by variables, like copying 't' to 'b') into new, distinct temporary variables ('a', 'b', 'c'). This suggests a lack of trust in Java's ability to evaluate compound expressions and an overly rigid, step-by-step procedural view of variable assignment.",
          "conceptual_gap": "Java efficiently calculates complex arithmetic expressions using standard operator precedence. The expression `c = (v1 - v0) / t;` is the standard and efficient way to perform this operation. Introducing intermediate variables `a` and `b`, especially when `b` is a redundant copy of `t`, demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of efficient variable utilization and expression evaluation structure in programming.",
