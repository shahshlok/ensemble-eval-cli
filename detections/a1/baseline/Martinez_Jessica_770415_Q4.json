The student appears to be reasoning as if the arithmetic expression is grouped the way it is written in math on paper, without recognizing that Java\u2019s fixed precedence rules require explicit parentheses to change the default grouping. As a result, the semi-perimeter `s` is computed incorrectly, which then propagates into Heron\u2019s formula and yields the wrong area.",
