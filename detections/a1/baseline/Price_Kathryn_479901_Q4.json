          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that printing a semicolon (`;`) when prompting for input somehow helps the scanner read exactly two values sequentially without the user explicitly providing separating whitespaces, or that the print statement structure ensures the user will input concatenated digits that are interpreted as two distinct numbers (e.g., typing '00' results in two separate double readings of 0 and 0).",
          "conceptual_gap": "The Java `Scanner` reads tokens based on standard delimiters (usually whitespace). The `System.out.print` prompt only affects what the user sees, not how `input.nextDouble()` splits the input stream. When the prompt `(x1, y1):` is displayed and the user types `00`, `input.nextDouble()` will consume the entire token `00` (which is parsed as 0.0), and the subsequent `input.nextDouble()` call will fail or wait for the next input, depending on whether the user pressed Enter/Space after 00. The code relies on the user providing two tokens (e.g., '0 0') for each prompt, but the prompt style suggests the student might misunderstand the required input format.",

The student defines `a1, b1`, then `a2, b2`, and `a3, b3` for three sequential calculations of differences, instead of reusing simpler variables like `dx` and `dy` for each side calculation, suggesting a view of computational steps as strictly linear and unique rather than cyclically reusable.",
