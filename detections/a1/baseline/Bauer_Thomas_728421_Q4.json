          "conceptual_gap": "In Euclidean geometry, three positive lengths derived from the distance between three points (P1, P2, P3) *must* satisfy the triangle inequality ($d(\\text{P}1, \\text{P}2) + d(\\text{P}2, \\text{P}3) \\ge d(\\text{P}1, \\text{P}3)$). Consequently, the product term inside the square root of Heron's formula, $s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)$, is mathematically guaranteed to be non-negative (zero for collinear points, positive otherwise). Therefore, the extensive conditional checks for triangle validity (Lines 64-72) and the subsequent check for a negative product (Lines 83-86) are logically redundant.",

          "conceptual_gap": "The Java `Scanner` object's `nextDouble()` method reads the next available double token, regardless of line breaks. If two numbers are entered sequentially on the same line (like '0 0' or even '00'), the first `nextDouble()` call consumes the first number (0), and the second `nextDouble()` call immediately consumes the second number (0) without waiting for further user input or a new separator, often leading to coordinates being mapped incorrectly across points (e.g., P1_x and P1_y are read, but the subsequent prompt for P2_x and P2_y is displayed after P1_y is already read, making the interactive experience confusing and buggy if the user enters multiple tokens when prompted for the first coordinate). This behavior makes the code highly susceptible to incorrect input parsing based on user habit.",
