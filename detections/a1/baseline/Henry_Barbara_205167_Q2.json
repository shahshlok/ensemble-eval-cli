The actual execution model is that the if-condition is evaluated to a single boolean value, and if that value is always true, the if-statement will always execute, making the condition pointless. The student\u2019s mental model treats the two sides of the OR as separate, necessary checks that together somehow provide extra safety or correctness, rather than recognizing that the combined expression has no filtering effect.",
