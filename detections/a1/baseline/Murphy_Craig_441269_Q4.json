          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that calling `scanner.nextDouble();` twice sequentially handles two pieces of input provided on the same line without needing any explicit delimiter handling (like reading a separator or newline), or that the prompt structure ' (x1, y1):' will automatically align with reading two doubles, even when the input is merged, like '00'.",
          "conceptual_gap": "When the student uses `scanner.nextDouble();` twice in a row (e.g., lines 10 and 11), the scanner reads tokens separated by whitespace. In the sample run input `00`, the Scanner treats this as a single token '00' (which parses as the double 0.0), and then attempts to read the second double (`y1`). Since the standard input stream is waiting for input, the next input provided by the user (which would be the `(x2, y2)` inputs) might be incorrectly consumed, or the program behavior might be confusing as it waits for input after consuming '00' as 0.0 for x1. In the specific sample run, the expected input handling for `00` followed by input for `(x2, y2)` is obscured, but the general pattern reveals a common misunderstanding: multiple `nextDouble()` calls need multiple separate input tokens, and the user input style (like `00` for (0, 0)) relies on specific, non-obvious tokenization rules.",
