          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, integer division by zero throws an ArithmeticException, but floating\u2011point (double/float) division by zero does not cause a runtime error; it yields special IEEE 754 values such as Infinity or NaN. By adding an if(t != 0) guard and defaulting the result to 0.0, the student is mixing a mathematical concern (division by zero is undefined) with an incorrect assumption about Java's runtime behavior for doubles. This leads them to silently produce a mathematically wrong result instead of either applying the specified formula uniformly or explicitly handling the undefined case.",

In Java, when division by zero is impossible (or the programmer accepts it as an exceptional case), the proper approach is to either use a direct calculation or throw an exception. The student's approach silently produces incorrect results (n=0) when t=0, rather than explicitly handling the error case. This suggests a misunderstanding about whether preventing crashes is the same as producing correct behavior.",

          "conceptual_gap": "The student has correctly identified the potential for division by zero (runtime exception) and attempts to prevent it. However, the chosen structure (`double n=0; if(t!=0) n=...`) is overly complex for initialization and calculation. In typical Java programming, the calculation is often done directly unless the conditional check dictates logic flow or termination. While the code is technically correct because it defaults to 0 if t=0, the use of unnecessary initialization outside the calculation block suggests a rigid adherence to defensive programming or a misunderstanding of variable scope initialization necessities, rather than simply structuring the formula.",
