The student may believe this is necessary for error handling or input validation, but Java's control flow will execute the block regardless. This suggests a misunderstanding of when and why conditionals are actually needed.",

The student calculates `avg_accel = 0.0` in the case of zero division, which is mathematically incorrect for $a/0$ unless $a=0$. This demonstrates a formal adherence to preventing division by zero without understanding the specifics of floating-point behavior or realizing that Java's floating-point system handles this scenario without crashing the program, thus the explicit check and assignment to `0.0` is unnecessary and potentially incorrect.",
