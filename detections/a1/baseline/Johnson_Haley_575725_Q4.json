          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that combined input prompts like `(x1, y1):00` mean that the user enters both the x- and y-coordinate immediately following the prompt, implying that a single `System.out.print` can handle reading two separate double values sequentially from the input stream, regardless of how the user formats the input (e.g., separating them by a space or new line).",
          "conceptual_gap": "While Java's `Scanner.nextDouble()` correctly reads consecutive numbers separated by whitespace, the student's implementation of the prompt structure assumes the input will be received inline immediately after the prompt for `(x1, y1):`. The sample run shows the format `(x1, y1):00`, implying $x_1=0$ and $y_1=0$, or perhaps $x_1=0$ and $y_1=0$ entered sequentially. The code's prompting mechanism (`System.out.print(\"(x1, y1):\");`) is executed once, and subsequent input reading, like `double y1 = input.nextDouble();`, does not produce a visual prompt to guide the user for the second required value (y1). This leads to confusing or unguided input sequences compared to the single-value-per-prompt pattern users often expect.",
          "error_manifestation": "Input sequence is unclear for the user, potentially leading to incorrect data entry if the user expects an explicit prompt for the second coordinate (y) or if they enter both values without knowing the expected input format.",
