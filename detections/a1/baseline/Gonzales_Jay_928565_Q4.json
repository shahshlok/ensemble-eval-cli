They view the program as a linear script without recognizing the need for or utility of procedural abstraction.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The instructions explicitly mention using the \"program made in question 3\" to calculate side lengths, implying the use of a function/method (procedural abstraction) for calculating distance. The student failed to utilize this concept, demonstrating a lack of understanding that methods are intended to encapsulate reusable logic, preventing code duplication and improving modularity.",
