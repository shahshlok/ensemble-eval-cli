          "conceptual_gap": "In reality, the Java program executes two explicit, sequential calls to `input.nextDouble()`. While this works if the user provides delimiter-separated input immediately, the lack of a distinct prompt or visual confirmation for the second variable (y1, y2, y3) demonstrates a failure to map the program's fine-grained I/O consumption steps back to the user interface design. The student overlooks the need for output granularity that mirrors input granularity.",

          "conceptual_gap": "The student misinterprets the role of the prompt and the behavior of the `Scanner`. The prompt `(x1, y1):` is displayed once, but two separate numerical inputs (`x1` and `y1`) are required from the user via `input.nextDouble()`. While `nextDouble()` correctly reads two numbers if they are separated by whitespace, the placement of the output prompts misleadingly suggests to the user that they should enter the pair immediately after the prompt, which runs counter to standard input practices and makes the resulting I/O messy and confusing, as seen in the sample run's input handling (e.g., `(x1, y1):00`).\n\nThe fundamental disconnect is assuming output formatting (the prompt) controls input parsing structure, rather than understanding that each call to `nextDouble()` consumes the next available token (number) in the input stream.",
          "error_manifestation": "Confusing and non-standard input/output flow according to the provided instructions, which requires the student to type both numbers on the same line without a second prompt, potentially leading to user errors if they expect a prompt for the second coordinate.",
