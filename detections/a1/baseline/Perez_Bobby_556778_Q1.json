          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, variables can be declared and assigned directly without pre-initialization to 0. The student is treating the variable `b` as though it needs a placeholder value before the conditional assignment. While the code works (0 is a valid default for division results when n=0), it suggests a misunderstanding that assignments within conditionals don't require prior initialization. The student may believe variables have an 'undefined' state in Java similar to some other languages, when in fact uninitialized local variables cause compile errors\u2014they don't default to 0.",
          "error_manifestation": "The code produces correct output, but the logic pattern reveals a defensive coding style based on a flawed mental model. If n were 0, the output would be 0 (the pre-initialized value), which silently masks the undefined mathematical case rather than handling it explicitly.",
