          "conceptual_gap": "In Java (and most programming languages), arithmetic operators follow a fixed precedence: multiplication and division are evaluated before addition and subtraction, and expressions are evaluated left-to-right for operators with the same precedence.

To mirror the mathematical formula `s = (side1 + side2 + side3) / 2`, the sum must be explicitly grouped with parentheses.
