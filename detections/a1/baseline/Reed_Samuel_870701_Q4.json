Instead of defining or calling a dedicated 'distance' method (likely created in Q3) to calculate side lengths, they copied and pasted the distance calculation formula three separate times (lines 23-25, 29-31, 35-37).

          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that when prompting the user for two adjacent inputs (x and y coordinates) on the same line, the `Scanner` will automatically pause or wait for a specific input delimiter (like a comma or spaces) based on the input format, or that they must type both digits of a number without a space if they intend it to be a single number followed by another single number.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The `Scanner`'s `nextDouble()` method reads tokens delimited by whitespace (by default). When the user inputs '00' in response to '(x1, y1):', the `Scanner` interprets this as two distinct tokens: '0' (for x1) and '0' (for y1), because there is an implicit whitespace delimiter between the digits when entered rapidly, or because the input reading mechanism tokenizes contiguous identical digits incorrectly when user input doesn't involve explicit spaces (though typically, this is handled correctly if the user types '0' then '0' quickly). The deeper issue, confirmed by the sample run, is how `nextDouble()` handles combined user input that lacks explicit delimiters (like '00' for x1, y1). In most environments, complex non-standard input like '00' results in the `Scanner` reading '0' for x1 and then immediately consuming the remaining '0' for y1. This mismatch between the prompt ('(x1, y1):') suggesting two inputs and the student's single prompt call reveals confusion about sequential reading.",
