          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that when the input prompt requests two values on the same line (e.g., '(x1, y1):'), the subsequent calls to a `Scanner` method, like `userInputScanner.nextDouble();`, will automatically consume whitespace or non-digit characters (like the comma or parentheses often present in coordinate notation) to correctly separate and read the two required numeric inputs, regardless of how the user formats the input.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The `Scanner` methods (like `nextDouble()`) only consume tokens delimited by whitespace (by default). If the user enters both coordinates concatenated without whitespace (e.g., `00` for (0, 0)) or separated by non-default delimiters (like a comma), the `nextDouble()` call will try to parse the entire input string as a single number or fail if it cannot. If the user uses the sample format `00` (which is interpreted as two integers `0` and `0` when reading numbers consecutively), the code works accidentally because the lack of space in the prompt encourages concatenated input, but this reading strategy is brittle and fails standard use cases where users might enter '0 0'. Furthermore, the logic relying on `00` being read as two separate numbers relies on how `nextDouble()` tokenizes when whitespace is absent, which is often tied to the specific token format. The prompt `(x1, y1):` gives no indication to the user that they must separate X and Y values with a space or other token delimiter.",
          "error_manifestation": "Potential runtime exception (`InputMismatchException`) or logical error (reading incorrect values) if the user enters coordinates separated by non-whitespace characters or if the input format '00' is not interpreted as two distinct numerical tokens effectively by the Scanner.",
