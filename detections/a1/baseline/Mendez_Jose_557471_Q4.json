          "conceptual_gap": "The Java `Scanner` reads tokens based on delimiters (usually whitespace). When two consecutive calls to `x.nextDouble()` are made (L7, L8), the scanner simply consumes the next two available numerical tokens found anywhere in the input stream (after the previous input). If the user enters slightly malformed or incomplete input for the first pair, the second `nextDouble()` call may prematurely consume tokens intended for the next coordinate pair (P2), severely desynchronizing the output prompts ((x2, y2):) from the required input data (x2, y2). Although the code yields the correct output for the sample run coordinates, it relies on the user providing six perfectly parsed, whitespace-separated numbers.",
