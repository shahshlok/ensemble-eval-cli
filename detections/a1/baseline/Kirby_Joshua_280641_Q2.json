If the logic were written simply as `gallonsNeeded = distance / milesPerGallon; cost = gallonsNeeded * pricePerGallon;`, the program would only crash if the check were missing. By structuring the code this way, the student shows an over-reliance on complex early branching to handle edge cases, resulting in overly nested logic (L15-L22).
