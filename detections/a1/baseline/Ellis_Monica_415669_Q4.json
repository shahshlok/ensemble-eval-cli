          "conceptual_gap": "The student fails to recognize that `nextDouble()` only consumes the next token (a number) from the input stream. For the sample run '00', Java reads '00' as a single number (0.0) for `x1`, but then the second required number for `y1` is missing, causing the subsequent calls to read input to fail or behave unexpectedly if subsequent input is provided without matching the prompt order. Specifically, the student's code reads **two** separate doubles for (x1, y1) but the sample run prompt implies a single input line, which if interpreted literally (00) will only provide one input token (0 or 00).",
          "error_manifestation": "If the user follows the format '00' as in the sample, `x1` gets the value 0.0, but the program then immediately tries to read `y1` from the non-existent next token, leading to an `InputMismatchException` or incorrect reading of subsequent input intended for other variables, because the student assumes '00' is tokenized into two separate inputs (0 and 0) or that the input handling is more lenient than it is.",

          "conceptual_gap": "While `nextDouble()` correctly handles spaces and newlines as delimiters, the prompt design and the sample run's peculiar input format ('00', '50', '05' without showing delimiters like spaces or newlines) suggest the student might assume that typing two numbers immediately (e.g., '0' then '0') satisfies two consecutive `nextDouble()` calls successfully, possibly by consuming the zero '0' twice, or that '00' is read as two separate tokens '0' and '0' based purely on the prompt structure, despite the input being potentially ambiguous or requiring specific input separation (space or enter) which is not explicitly demonstrated or handled robustly by the provided prompt/sample pairing.",
