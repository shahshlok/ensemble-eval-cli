The zero-initialization pattern suggests they're thinking like this is C or another language where uninitialized variables contain garbage. Additionally, checking `if(n!=0)` before computing `r` is reasonable, but if the input is 0, `r` silently remains 0 rather than indicating an error\u2014this could hide invalid input.",
