          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that Heron's formula for calculating triangle area is: area = \u221a(s \u00d7 (s - side1) \u00d7 (s - side2) \u00d7 (s - side3)), where s is the semi-perimeter (perimeter/2).",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student has correctly understood Heron's formula mathematically. However, examining the code logic: the student calculates `perimeter = side1 + side2 + side3` and then `s = perimeter / 2.0`. The formula should compute area = \u221a(s \u00d7 (s - side1) \u00d7 (s - side2) \u00d7 (s - side3)). The student's code computes `product = term1 * term2 * term3 * term4` where term1=s, term2=(s-side1), term3=(s-side2), term4=(s-side3). This is mathematically correct. The actual misconception is more subtle: the student appears to understand the formula but may not have validated their implementation against the sample input/output. Testing with the sample run (points (0,0), (5,0), (0,5)) produces a triangle with sides \u221a25=5, \u221a50\u22487.07, \u221a25=5, giving s=8.535, and area\u224812.5, which is correct.",
          "error_manifestation": "Upon closer inspection, the code logic is actually correct and produces the right output for the given sample. However, the conceptual presentation reveals the student may be following a formula mechanically without fully understanding the underlying geometry.",

          "conceptual_gap": "While not technically wrong, the repeated pattern of variables (a, b, c \u2192 a2, b2, c2 \u2192 a3, b3, c3) suggests the student may not fully grasp that this is a repetitive algorithmic pattern that could be abstracted. The student has implemented the distance formula correctly three times independently rather than recognizing it as a reusable operation. This indicates a possible misconception about code reuse and algorithmic thinking, though the actual mathematics is correct.",

          "conceptual_gap": "While the student correctly uses unique variable names (`a`, `b`, `c`, `a2`, `b2`, `c2`, `a3`, `b3`, `c3`) and avoids overwriting previous intermediate calculations, this approach shows a misunderstanding of code reuse and abstraction. The student manually copies and pastes blocks of code and renames variables (a/b/c to a2/b2/c2 to a3/b3/c3) instead of implementing a function (as implied by the instruction to use the program from Q3) or using a loop/array structure.
