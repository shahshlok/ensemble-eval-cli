          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that a multi-step mathematical formula must be meticulously broken down and calculated one part at a time, with each intermediate result (numerator, denominator, intermediate quotient) stored in its own dedicated variable before the final result can be assigned to the target variable. They feel compelled to map every logical step onto a unique variable assignment.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student fails to utilize Java's capability to evaluate complex expressions in a single line using operator precedence and grouping (parentheses). This leads to unnecessary creation of intermediate variables (`a`, `b`, `c`) and redundant assignments (like assigning `c` to `acceleration`), suggesting a mental model where expression evaluation must proceed by sequential algebraic substitution rather than simultaneous calculation.",
