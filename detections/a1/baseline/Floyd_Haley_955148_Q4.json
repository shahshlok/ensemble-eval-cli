They seem to think that because they calculated 'sumOfSidesValue' previously, they can ignore parentheses when they use the component parts again, or that concatenation applies somehow: all three sides are summed, and then that total is divided by 2; the lack of parentheses must not matter since the formula is described that way.",

The conceptual gap is a failure to apply Java's operator precedence rules correctly when translating a mathematical formula to code, leading to an incorrect calculation for the semi-perimeter. Although they have already computed the full sum in `sumOfSidesValue`, they do not use it, which suggests a belief that re-typing the components might somehow be equivalent, or they simply forgot the precedence rule.",
