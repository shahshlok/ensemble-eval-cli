          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, standard variables can be used directly in any expression once initialized, and there is no performance, safety, or correctness benefit derived from copying variable values into new variables (e.g., lines 17-19) immediately before use. This redundancy clutters the code and demonstrates a misunderstanding of how Java variables hold and allow access to their values across the scope of the method.",

However, if the compiler can guarantee that *every* execution path assigns a value to the variable before it is used (such as assigning it inside an exhaustive `if/else` structure), explicit initial assignment is unnecessary.
