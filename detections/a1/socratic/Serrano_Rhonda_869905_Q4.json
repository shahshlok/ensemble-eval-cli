          "conceptual_gap": "While the code will technically compile and run correctly (since x1, x2, x3 are distinct identifiers from x), this reveals a lack of awareness about variable scope and naming conventions. The student chose 'x' as the parameter name (likely copied from the signature template) but didn't recognize this as problematic when later using x-coordinates. In Java, while this works, it demonstrates unclear thinking about variable namespacing and increases cognitive load. A stronger mental model would recognize that parameter names and variable names should be chosen to avoid such collision patterns.",

While functionally correct, this indicates the student may not fully internalize the mapping between mathematical notation and code variables.

This suggests a mental model where 'any name works' rather than 'names should reflect meaning'.",
