          "conceptual_gap": "The student is translating the notational structure of algebra (defining components like 'numerator' and 'denominator') too literally into imperative code steps. In Java, complex expressions are efficiently evaluated using operator precedence, and separating steps requires computational overhead (memory allocation and assignment) without any functional benefit for a calculation as simple as `(v1 - v0) / t`. The variable `denominatorTime` is assigned the value of `timeT` on line 34, which is purely redundant.",

While the code is functionally correct, it reveals a mental model where the student thinks each mathematical operation must be isolated into its own variable, suggesting uncertainty about operator precedence and expression evaluation.
