          "conceptual_gap": "While floating-point rounding errors are real, the student has added checks (lines 89-91 clamping negative values, and line 96 checking for non-negativity) that suggest they don't fully trust the mathematical validity of Heron's formula. The student appears to believe that after correctly computing s, (s-side1), (s-side2), and (s-side3), the product could become negative due to rounding\u2014but this is only possible if the triangle inequality is violated or the input doesn't form a valid triangle. The correct approach is either: (1) trust the math if inputs are valid, or (2) validate the triangle inequality upfront. The current approach masks underlying issues and produces silent failures (area = 0 for invalid triangles) rather than explicit error handling.",
          "error_manifestation": "The code runs without errors but produces potentially misleading output. For degenerate or invalid triangles, it silently outputs area 0 instead of informing the user of invalid input. The defensive clamping suggests the student doesn't understand that Heron's formula guarantees a non-negative result for valid triangles.",
