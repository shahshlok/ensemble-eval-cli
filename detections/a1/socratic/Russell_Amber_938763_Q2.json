The line `if(b!=0)d=(a/b)*c;` executes immediately when the program reaches it, using whatever values `a`, `b`, and `c` hold at that exact moment. At line 8, `b` is 0 (copied from `n=0`), so the condition fails. No amount of later reassignment changes the fact that this calculation already happened and overwrote (or didn't) `d`. The calculation must happen *after* input is received. Java executes instructions one by one in the order they appear.",
