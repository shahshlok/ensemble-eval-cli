          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, assigning a value from one variable to another creates a copy of that value at that moment in time. The chain `double b = a * price; double cost = b;` is functionally identical to `double cost = a * price;`. The student may not fully grasp that variables are merely names for values in memory, and that unnecessary intermediaries don't add semantic meaning or computational benefit. Each assignment is independent and doesn't create any special relationship or finalization.",
