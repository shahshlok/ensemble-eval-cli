          "conceptual_gap": "While `nextDouble()` correctly handles delimiters and reads the next token as a double, the student's paired use of `System.out.print` followed by two `nextDouble()` calls assumes a specific input pattern management that could be fragile depending on the user's interaction (e.g., entering (x1, y1):00 as '00' then pressing enter, resulting in an InputMismatchException if the Scanner can't tokenize '00' into two doubles, or requiring the student to input all coordinates consecutively separated by spaces/newlines: '0 0 5 0 0 5'). The sample run shows the user entering `00` for `(x1, y1):`. This suggests the student might expect multiple values to be read seamlessly by consecutive `nextDouble()` calls after a single prompt, which is true but relies entirely on the user providing spaces or newlines between the numbers, making the error handling implicit rather than explicit (like reading a full line and then splitting). The code works for the sample run's behavior where the numbers were likely separated by spaces or newlines, but the *mental model* about sequential token reading is sometimes confused with reading a line and parsing substrings.",
          "error_manifestation": "Wrong output or potential `InputMismatchException` or `NoSuchElementException` if the input separator format is unexpected (e.g., if the user enters '00' expecting two numbers without a space, or if they input only one number and hit enter, the second `nextDouble()` waits indefinitely or throws an exception). Since the provided sample works, the specific issue here is minor, but represents a common misunderstanding of Scanner tokenization.",
