          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that they must explicitly check for division by zero before performing division, and that if this condition is true, they should initialize the result to a default value (0.0) rather than either preventing invalid input or allowing the calculation to proceed.",
          "conceptual_gap": "While defensive programming is a good practice, the student has misunderstood the problem context. The problem statement assumes valid input (time t will be a meaningful positive value). By initializing `acceleration = 0.0` and only computing it when `t != 0.0`, the student is creating a false case where invalid input silently produces a misleading result (0.0) instead of either: (1) validating input upfront, (2) throwing an exception, or (3) trusting the problem specification. In Java, division by zero with floating-point numbers actually produces `Infinity` or `NaN`, not a crash. The student's approach masks the real issue rather than handling it properly.",
          "error_manifestation": "The code produces incorrect output (0.0) if a user enters t=0, which doesn't represent a real physical scenario. This silent failure is worse than an explicit error because it doesn't alert the user that something went wrong.",
