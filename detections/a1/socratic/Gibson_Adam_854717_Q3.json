          "conceptual_gap": "While Java allows single-letter variables, this reveals a misconception about code clarity and maintainability. The student appears to lack understanding that variable names should be meaningful and self-documenting. More fundamentally, this suggests the student may not realize that breaking down a complex formula into many intermediate steps (lines 7-8) with cryptic names makes the code harder to verify against the mathematical formula and harder to debug. The student hasn't internalized that code is read by humans first, computers second.",
