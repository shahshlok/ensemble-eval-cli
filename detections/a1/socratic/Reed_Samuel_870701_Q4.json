          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that when prompting the user for two numerical inputs (e.g., x1 and y1) on a single line, the standard Java `Scanner` method `nextDouble()` will automatically interpret two digits entered without a space (like '00', '50', or '05' in the sample run) as two separate numerical values for the two sequential calls to `nextDouble()`. For instance, '50' is interpreted as 5.0 and 0.0.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The Java `Scanner` class, when using `nextDouble()`, reads tokens delimited by whitespace (or the platform-specific delimiter). If the user enters '50' followed by the newline, `nextDouble()` consumes the entire '50' as a single double (50.0). Since the student calls `nextDouble()` twice for each coordinate pair (e.g., x1 and y1), the second call waits for new input, or it consumes the next available token separated by whitespace, which is absent here. The student is relying on undocumented or nonexistent parsing behavior for concatenating two numbers without a delimiter.",
          "error_manifestation": "Incorrect output. Based on how the sample run inputs are displayed (`(x1, y1):00`), if the user actually typed '00\n50\n05\n', the code would attempt to read '00' (-> 0.0) for x1, then wait for another input for y1. If the user is entering concatenated digits like the prompt suggests, the program will likely assign the combined value to the first variable (e.g., x1 = 50.0) and then hang waiting for y1, or assign subsequent concatenated inputs to the remaining variables in sequence, leading to incorrect point coordinates.",
