          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that using descriptive variable names like 'dy_component' and 'y2_value' instead of the straightforward 'y2' will make the code clearer or that the variable name should reflect its role in the computation rather than its semantic meaning from the problem.",
          "conceptual_gap": "While variable naming is a style choice, the student appears to conflate problem semantics with implementation details. The problem explicitly defines variables as x1, y1, x2, y2. Using 'y2_value' and 'dy_component' adds cognitive overhead for readers trying to map code to the mathematical problem. The student hasn't grasped that meaningful variable names should align with problem terminology unless there's a clear reason to abstract them.",
          "error_manifestation": "No runtime error or wrong output, but the code is harder to verify against the problem specification. A reader must mentally translate 'y2_value' back to 'y2' and 'dy_component' back to the y-difference component to understand correctness.",

          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that variable names can be arbitrarily varied throughout the code without maintaining consistency with either the problem definition or their own established pattern. They use 'x1', 'y1', 'x2' directly, but then rename 'y2' to 'y2_value' and the computed differences to 'dx' and 'dy_component' with no clear principle.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student hasn't internalized that consistency in naming conventions is important for code readability and maintainability. Either all intermediate computations should be named descriptively (dx, dy) or none should be. Mixing patterns (direct input variable names like 'x1' with renamed inputs like 'y2_value') suggests unclear thinking about what makes code clear.",
