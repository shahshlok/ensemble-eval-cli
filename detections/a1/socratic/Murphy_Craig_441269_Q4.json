The sample run shows '00' and '50' as single inputs, but the code expects two separate numeric inputs. The student's mental model assumes the user will naturally know to separate values appropriately, but hasn't considered ambiguity in the prompt design.",

          "conceptual_gap": "While Java's `Scanner.nextDouble()` correctly reads and parses the next available token as a double, the student's code structure implicitly assumes that the user input format will exactly match the two required `nextDouble()` calls without any issues related to input token consumption or potential input errors if the user enters the data in an unexpected non-tokenized format (like '00' or attempting to enter a comma). Although the sample run supports paired input (e.g., '00' implies 0 and 0), this pattern reveals an implicit, rather than explicit, understanding of how input tokens are separated and consumed.",
