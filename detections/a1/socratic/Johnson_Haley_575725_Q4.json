This suggests they view code reuse primarily as copy-pasting rather than utilizing abstract methods.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The conceptual gap is the failure to recognize the value and execution mechanics of procedural abstraction (methods/functions) for code modularity and reusability. In the Java notional machine, methods provide a structured way to execute a common block of code multiple times by passing arguments, which the student bypassed by repeating the calculation steps three times.",
