          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that using different variable names (v0, v1_value, t_time) for the same logical entities from the problem is acceptable and won't confuse the relationship between the mathematical formula and the code implementation.",
          "conceptual_gap": "While Java allows any valid identifier, the student has created a disconnect between the problem specification (which uses v0, v1, t) and the implementation (which uses v0, v1_value, t_time). This suggests the student may not fully appreciate that readable, consistent naming conventions are crucial for translating mathematical formulas into code. The formula uses v1, but the code stores it in v1_value, making the code harder to verify against the specification.",
          "error_manifestation": "No compile or runtime error, but potential for logic errors during verification and reduced code readability. The student's code actually works correctly, but the naming inconsistency indicates a possible weakness in translating between problem notation and implementation.",
