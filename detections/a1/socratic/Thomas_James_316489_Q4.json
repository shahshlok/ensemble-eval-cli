          "conceptual_gap": "The student appears to assume that Scanner.nextDouble() can intelligently extract numeric values from formatted text. However, Scanner.nextDouble() reads the next token as a double and will throw an exception if it encounters '(' or ',' characters. The sample input shows \"00\" and \"50\" as single inputs, not \"(0, 0)\" and \"(5, 0)\". The student's code calls nextDouble() twice per line, which would require the user to enter two space or newline-separated numbers, not a formatted pair in parentheses.",

More critically, the student hasn't recognized that they could have named the Scanner something like \"scanner\" or \"input\" to avoid semantic confusion between the input mechanism and the data being input. This suggests a mental model where the student isn't clearly distinguishing between the tool for input and the data itself.",

          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that when reading a single printed prompt using `Scanner`, multiple variable assignments separated by commas, like `double x1=x.nextDouble(),y1=x.nextDouble();`, will automatically consume input that is separated by a space or specific delimiters, even if the user provides the input on a single line sequentially, or perhaps that the comma separation implies reading two distinct inputs.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, `x.nextDouble()` consumes the next token available on the input stream that can be parsed as a double. The implementation correctly calls `nextDouble()` twice for `x1` and `y1`. However, the sample run input structure implies the student might be relying on how the user enters '00' (which usually implies two separate integers '0' and '0' that get read as doubles `0.0` and `0.0`), or they assume the syntax `(x1, y1):` guarantees a specific input format matching the command structure. The primary observation is that the student must rely on the user entering two separate numerical tokens (like '0 0' or '0\n0') immediately after the single prompt, potentially misunderstanding how multiple assignments on one line relate to input token consumption.",
