          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, integer division by zero does throw an ArithmeticException at runtime, but floating-point division (using double or float) does not. Instead, Java follows the IEEE 754 standard: dividing a nonzero double by 0.0 produces +Infinity or -Infinity, and 0.0 / 0.0 produces NaN. These are special double values, not runtime errors. The student's comment indicates they are applying the mental model of integer arithmetic errors to floating-point arithmetic, which leads them to write defensive checks that are unnecessary for correctness and may hide the need to handle Infinity/NaN explicitly if those cases are truly problematic for the application.",

Multiplying by zero is a valid operation, and explicitly checking for `pricePerGallonInDollars != 0.0` before performing the calculation `totalDrivingCostInDollars = gallonsOfFuelNeeded * pricePerGallonInDollars` only suppresses the calculation if the price is exactly zero, which is likely intended behavior anyway (a free trip).
