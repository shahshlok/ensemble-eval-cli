          "conceptual_gap": "The Java `Scanner` object tokenizes input based on delimiters, typically whitespace. If the user enters `00`, it is usually treated as a single token (0.0). The student's code, calling `nextDouble()` twice, will consume the first token (0.0) for `pointOneXValue`, and then the second `nextDouble()` call will block, waiting for a second token, leading to improper input sequencing compared to the expected sample run.",

Since the problem description's sample output shows '00', '50', and '05' on subsequent lines after the prompts, the student assumes the user is obligated to enter two numbers immediately following the prompt on the same line, separated by a space or enter.",
          "conceptual_gap": "While the code correctly uses two sequential `userInputScanner.nextDouble()` calls to read two numbers, the I/O prompting is fragile regarding user input habits. The prompt '(x1, y1):' strongly suggests a format like '(0, 0)', but the code only reads the numerical values. If a user tries to type '(0, 0)', the `nextDouble()` call will fail or read only the '('. However, based on the provided sample run, the expected sequence is often achieved by inputting two numbers separated by whitespace immediately after the prompt. The misconception lies in the belief that the print prompt ensures the user will seamlessly provide two double values without needing complex token scanning or handling of non-numeric characters like parentheses or commas shown in the prompt's visual suggestion.",
