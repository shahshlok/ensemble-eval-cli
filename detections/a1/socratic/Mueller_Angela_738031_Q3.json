          "conceptual_gap": "While this isn't a runtime error, it reveals a misunderstanding about code clarity and maintainability. The student has mapped: a=x1, b=y1, c=x2, d=y2, e=(x2-x1), f=(y2-y1), g=e\u00b2, h=f\u00b2, i=g+h, j=\u221ai. However, Java (and professional programming) values self-documenting code where variable names reflect their purpose. The student may not yet understand that code is read far more often than it's written, and that meaningful names are essential for understanding.",
          "error_manifestation": "No compile error or runtime error, but the code is difficult to read, debug, and maintain. This suggests the student hasn't internalized best practices around variable naming conventions.",

          "conceptual_gap": "While Java's comma operator for variable declaration is syntactically valid, it can obscure the number of variables being declared and makes code harder to read. The student may not understand that code readability and maintainability should take precedence over brevity. Beginners should typically declare variables one per line to make the code structure explicit and reduce cognitive load when reading.",

While mathematically correct, excessive intermediate variable assignments (e=c-a, f=d-b, g=e*e, h=f*f, i=g+h) introduce unnecessary overhead and complexity compared to direct calculation using nested expressions, which the Java Notional Machine efficiently handles. The student is overly simulating a step-by-step algebraic substitution process rather than combining steps into efficient expressions.",
