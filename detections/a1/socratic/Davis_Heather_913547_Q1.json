          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that breaking down a complex formula into multiple intermediate variables is necessary or that the formula cannot be computed in a single step. The student thinks each part of the equation needs its own variable before proceeding to the next calculation.",
          "conceptual_gap": "While breaking down calculations is sometimes pedagogically useful, the student may not fully understand that expressions can be nested and evaluated in a single statement. In Java, double b = (v1 - v0) / t; is more direct than storing a = v1 - v0 first, then using it. The student's approach suggests they think calculations must happen sequentially in separate steps rather than understanding that complex expressions are evaluated according to operator precedence in a single operation.",
