          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that variable names are merely labels and that the computer can infer their semantic meaning from context. They think that because they use the name 'x' for the Scanner object, the subsequent variables 'y' and 'n' will somehow be understood as 'x1', 'y1' inputs, and that 'a' and 'b' will be understood as 'x2', 'y2' inputs.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, variable names are syntactic identifiers with no inherent semantic meaning to the runtime. The variable 'x' is a Scanner object, not a coordinate. When the student reads values into 'y' and 'n', these are simply double values in memory\u2014they are not automatically associated with the conceptual meaning of 'x1' and 'y1' just because that was the user's intent. Variable names don't convey mathematical relationships; the code logic must explicitly encode them.",
          "error_manifestation": "The code produces incorrect output. The program reads the inputs in the correct order (x1, y1, x2, y2), but the variable assignments are semantically misaligned: 'y' holds x1, 'n' holds y1, 'a' holds x2, 'b' holds y2. Despite this confusion, the arithmetic happens to work correctly because the formula is applied consistently to whatever values are stored in these variables, but the code's intention is obscured and error-prone.",

          "conceptual_gap": "While creating intermediate variables is sometimes useful for readability or debugging, the student's approach here suggests a lack of understanding that the original mathematical formula\u2014$\\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2}$\u2014could be expressed directly in code with better semantic transparency. The proliferation of single-letter variables (c, d, e, f) actually *reduces* clarity because it distances the code from the mathematical intent and makes it harder to verify correctness against the specification.",
          "error_manifestation": "No runtime error, but the code is harder to review and verify against the problem specification.
