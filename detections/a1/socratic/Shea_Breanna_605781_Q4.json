          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, input.nextDouble() reads and consumes only the next token from the input stream that can be successfully parsed as a double. When the user provides input like '00' for '(x1, y1):', the student is likely expecting to provide two values (x1=0, y1=0). However, the subsequent two calls to input.nextDouble() rely on the user providing two numbers separated by spaces or newlines (e.g., '0 0'). If the user types '00' and hits enter, the first token '00' (parsed as 0.0) is assigned to x1, and the second y1 is waiting for input, which leads to the prompt ' (x2, y2):' appearing before the second value for (x1, y1) is consumed. The user input '00' in the sample run is ambiguous; if it means '0' then '0', the student's code will work because the two calls to nextDouble() will consume the two tokens. However, the student's prompting structure shows a lack of clarity on one-to-one correspondence between nextDouble() calls and expected user interactions visible on the screen.",

If the user enters both 'x1' and 'y1' on the same physical line without spaces or presses enter after the first value, the subsequent input lines will be misaligned with the intended variable assignments and prompts, or the program will hang waiting for input.",
