The student seems fearful of reassigning a temporary variable for a repetitive calculation step, suggesting they view local variables as unique immutable labels tied permanently to their initial purpose, rather than reusable temporary storage registers.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, temporary local variables can and should be reused via reassignment once their initial value has served its purpose and the resulting stable value (like `side1Length`) has been computed and stored. The student's unnecessary creation of over 15 unique intermediate variables for three repetitions of the same distance calculation pattern demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of variable declaration scope, memory reuse, and code efficiency.",
