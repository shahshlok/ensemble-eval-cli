They use 'y2_value' for the second y-coordinate but 'x_diff' and 'yDiff' for differences, mixing camelCase naming styles without recognizing the inconsistency.",

The student appears to treat variable naming as arbitrary rather than understanding that consistent naming conventions (like camelCase) serve a semantic purpose in communicating intent. More importantly, this suggests the student may not fully appreciate that variable names should clearly reflect their purpose and maintain consistency for clarity.",
