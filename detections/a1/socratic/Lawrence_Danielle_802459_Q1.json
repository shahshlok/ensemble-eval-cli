          "conceptual_gap": "While checking for division by zero is good practice, the student's implementation silently returns an incorrect result (0.0) when t is 0, rather than either: (1) explicitly handling the error case with an error message, (2) throwing an exception, or (3) understanding that the problem specification assumes valid input. The student conflates 'preventing a crash' with 'producing correct output'. In the context of this assignment, there's no indication that t=0 is a valid input case to handle\u2014the mathematical formula is undefined at t=0.",
          "error_manifestation": "Silent logical error: if the user accidentally enters t=0, the program produces acceleration=0.0 without any warning, which is mathematically incorrect and misleading. The user won't know the input was invalid.",

The student may believe that readability always improves with more intermediate variables, but this introduces unnecessary complexity and makes the code less directly connected to the formula.

          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, local variables must be definitely assigned before use. While the student correctly initializes 'acceleration' on Line 12, the excessive introduction of the 'if (t != 0.0)' block suggests a focus on mitigating division by zero (which is good) combined with a structure unnecessary for a typical assignment statement. More critically, the student breaks the calculation into two temporary variables (`acceleration = 0.0;` then `double numerator = v1 - v0;` then `acceleration = numerator / t;`) when Java allows the direct calculation: `double acceleration = (v1 - v0) / t;` immediately after input, relying on the guarantee of definite instantiation required for printing later. The defensive structure adds complexity without addressing the core assignment rules if `t` could potentially be zero (in which case the initialization `acceleration = 0.0` handles the zero division scenario correctly for the output requirement).",
