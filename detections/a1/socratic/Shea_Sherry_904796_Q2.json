To reflect new inputs, the program must explicitly recompute the dependent variables *after* reading the user input. Here, the student computes `gallonsOfFuelUsed` and `totalCostOfDriving` while all inputs are still at their initial 0.0 values, and then updates the input variables afterward, expecting the earlier calculations to somehow update.
