They don't realize that the sample input '00', '50', '05' are being interpreted as single numbers by nextDouble(), not as coordinate pairs.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student misunderstands how Scanner.nextDouble() works. It reads the next double value from input, regardless of how the prompt is worded. The sample input shows '00', '50', '05' which should be interpreted as x1=0, y1=0, x2=5, y2=0, x3=0, y3=5 (six inputs total), but the student's prompt structure suggests they may not fully understand that each nextDouble() call reads one separate number sequentially. The prompt '(x1, y1):' linguistically suggests a pair, but the code correctly calls nextDouble() twice for two separate inputs.",
          "error_manifestation": "While the code structure is actually correct for parsing six separate numbers, the student may be confused about the actual input format expected, as evidenced by the mismatch between the prompt format '(x1, y1):' suggesting paired input and the sequential nextDouble() calls. This could lead to user confusion during execution.",

They may not realize there's ambiguity or poor practice here, though Java's scope rules prevent actual collision since the double variables are locally scoped after the Scanner.",
          "conceptual_gap": "While not technically a runtime error due to Java's scoping rules, this demonstrates a misconception about variable naming clarity. The student uses 'x' for the Scanner and then 'x1', 'x2', 'x3' for coordinates. This shows confusion about the distinction between an object reference and numeric variables. A more fundamental issue: the student may not understand that good naming practices prevent confusion and that reusing similar names across different semantic purposes is poor design.",

Instead of creating a helper method (or calling one from Q3) to calculate distance given two points, they hard-coded the distance formula inline. This violates the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle and shows they may not fully grasp how to decompose problems by calling existing methods. The instructions explicitly reference using code from Q3, suggesting a method should be called, not reimplemented.",

          "conceptual_gap": "While Java's `Scanner` is flexible and can handle input separated by whitespace (including newlines), the specific interaction implied by the sample run ('00' entered for (x1, y1)) relies on the Scanner treating '00' as two separate tokens if entered as '0 0' or similar. When the sample run shows the user typing `00` followed by pressing enter, the `Scanner` typically consumes `00` as the *first* double (`x1`), and then waits for the *second* double (`y1`). The student code works *only* if the user provides input appropriately tokenized (e.g., '0' '0', '5' '0', '0' '5'), but the prompt structure and the sample input suggest an implicit belief that the single input line `(x1, y1):00` somehow handles two variables from concatenated input, which is often not the case unless the input fields are explicitly delimited by whitespace or newlines by the user.",
