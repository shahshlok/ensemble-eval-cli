          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that writing the same mathematical calculation inline multiple times is functionally equivalent to or even preferable to calling a single, reusable method defined previously (as implied by the instruction to use the program from Q3). They see the calculation itself as the core requirement, neglecting the structural mandate for modularity.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student misunderstands procedural abstraction, a core concept of the Java programming model. They failed to recognize that methods (like the inferred distance calculation from Q3) are the primary mechanism for abstracting repeated logic. By reimplementing the calculation three times, they demonstrate a view where sequential, self-contained code blocks are preferred over reusable procedural definitions, violating good programming practice and explicit instructions.",
