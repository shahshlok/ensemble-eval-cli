          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that when a variable is intended to hold a default or 'safe' value (like 0.0) in a specific execution path (such as the `else` block handling division by zero), this value must be explicitly assigned within that block, regardless of whether the variable was already initialized to 0.0 prior to the conditional statement.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In the Java execution model, if the `if` condition on Line 29 evaluates to false (i.e., `timeInput` is 0.0), the variable `averageAccelerationResult` retains the value it was initialized with on Line 23 (which is 0.0). The explicit re-assignment to `0.0` inside the `else` block (Line 34) is functionally redundant, demonstrating a structural misunderstanding of how initial assignments persist when conditional branches are skipped.",

Instead, they feel compelled to break down the formula into minimal sequential steps by storing intermediate results in dedicated 'holder' variables.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The Java machine model is fully capable of handling complex arithmetic expressions based on operator precedence and parenthesis (e.g., `(v1 - v0) / t`). The use of `velocityDifferenceHolder` is unnecessary scaffolding. While not an error, it reflects a mental model where the programmer must explicitly manage every sub-step of a calculation, treating the computer as needing procedural hand-holding rather than expression parsing.",
