They do not see the need for descriptive variable names, as the variable's meaning is only relevant for the few lines surrounding its calculation.",

Relying on sequential single letters (like `g`, `j`, `m` for side lengths, and `e, f` for delta values) severely diminishes code readability and maintainability.

The student appears to think that as long as the logic is correct, variable naming doesn't matter.

The student hasn't internalized that code is primarily read by humans, not just executed by machines.",
