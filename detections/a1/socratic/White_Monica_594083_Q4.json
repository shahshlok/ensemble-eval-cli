If the user inputs '00', `nextDouble()` reads this as a single token representing the number 0.0. The first variable assignment (`x1`) is satisfied, but the second variable assignment (`y1`) remains blocked, waiting for the next valid, delimited numerical token. The student has a flawed mental model of how `Scanner` handles tokenization.",
