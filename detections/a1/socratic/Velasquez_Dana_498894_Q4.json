The student thinks the parentheses and comma in the prompt are merely instructional and don't affect how input should be parsed.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student hasn't recognized that the sample input '00', '50', and '05' suggests the input format is actually two digits concatenated together (like '00' for x1=0, y1=0), or alternatively, the user inputs space/newline-separated values. The code uses two consecutive nextDouble() calls for each coordinate pair, which assumes the input format is 'x1 y1 x2 y2 x3 y3' on separate lines or space-separated. However, looking at the sample run where '(x1, y1):00' is entered, it appears the student may have misunderstood how Scanner.nextDouble() tokenizes input. The code will actually work if inputs are space/newline-separated, but the sample suggests '00' as a single entry, which would cause a parsing error.",
          "error_manifestation": "Input mismatch - if the user enters '00' as shown in the sample, Scanner.nextDouble() will throw an InputMismatchException because '00' is not a valid double format. The program crashes rather than reading coordinates correctly.",

The student hasn't internalized that variable names should reflect their purpose and type.
