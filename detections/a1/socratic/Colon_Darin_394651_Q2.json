This means the `if` statement is logically redundant and does not actually guard or distinguish any case. The gap is that the student does not yet reason about boolean expressions as precise logical formulas with truth conditions; instead, they seem to treat the condition as a kind of narrative checklist (\"either this or that\") without realizing that, as written, it cannot ever be false.",
