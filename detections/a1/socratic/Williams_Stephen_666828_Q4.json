          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that for complex calculations, even if the logic is required multiple times and a function for it exists (or should exist, based on Q3 instruction), it is safer or necessary to copy and paste the entire implementation formula directly into the sequential main flow rather than relying on abstracting the logic into a reusable method. This avoidance suggests an incomplete mental model of how user-defined methods are declared, invoked, and used for modularity within a Java program's scope.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The core concept of modular programming involves abstracting repeated logic into methods/functions to promote code reuse and readability (DRY principle). The student executes the distance calculation logic three separate times using explicit, duplicated formulas (lines 31-35, 38-42, 45-47). This avoids the standard practice of defining a single distance calculation method (as likely required in Q3) and calling it repeatedly, indicating a procedural preference over object-oriented/modular design, or a misunderstanding of user-defined method scope constraints.",
