          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that using different variable names (side1, side_2, Side3) for the same conceptual entities doesn't matter, as long as they use the right names when they need them. They think the computer will 'understand' that side_2 and Side3 refer to the same logical quantities regardless of naming convention.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, variable names are case-sensitive and must be used consistently. Using 'side_2', 'Side3', and 'side1' creates three distinct variables. While the code technically works here because all three variables are used consistently in both the s calculation and area calculation, the inconsistent naming suggests the student doesn't fully appreciate that Java treats these as completely separate identifiers. This reflects a mental model where naming conventions are viewed as suggestions rather than requirements.",
          "error_manifestation": "No immediate runtime error or wrong output in this case, but the code is brittle and suggests a fragile understanding. If the student later tried to use 'side2' instead of 'side_2', or 'Side_3' instead of 'Side3', the code would fail with a 'variable not found' error.",

          "conceptual_gap": "The sample input shows '00', '50', and '05' as complete inputs on separate lines. The student's code calls nextDouble() twice per point, which means for input '00', the first nextDouble() reads '0' and the second reads '0'. However, the sample run appears to show 3 lines of input (one per point), not 6. The student seems to misunderstand the relationship between the prompt format and the actual input mechanism. The code assumes the user will enter space-separated or line-separated values that align with multiple nextDouble() calls, but this isn't explicitly guided.",
          "error_manifestation": "The code may work if the user enters values in the expected format (space or line-separated), but it shows a lack of explicit input validation or clear prompting. The discrepancy between the sample run (3 lines) and the code structure (6 nextDouble() calls) suggests confusion about input handling.",
