          "conceptual_gap": "While using descriptive names is a good practice, the student seems to lack confidence that 'v1' and 't' are perfectly valid identifiers in Java. The inconsistency between using 'v0' directly but renaming 'v1' to 'v1_value' and 't' to 't_time' suggests the student may not fully understand that variable names are arbitrary and don't affect the mathematical computation. The student may believe that the variable names need to describe their purpose to function correctly, or that mathematical notation requires special naming conventions.",
