          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that they need to explicitly break down the distance formula into multiple intermediate variable assignments (calculating differences, then squares, then summing) rather than computing the formula more directly or in-line. They may think that 'showing their work' step-by-step is necessary or that the computer cannot handle complex expressions.",
          "conceptual_gap": "While the student's approach is not incorrect and will produce the right answer, it reveals a mental model gap: the student may not fully appreciate that Java can evaluate complex arithmetic expressions in a single statement. The student decomposes (x\u2082-x\u2081)\u00b2 + (y\u2082-y\u2081)\u00b2 into four separate variables (a, b, c, d) when they could compute Math.sqrt((x2-x1)*(x2-x1) + (y2-y1)*(y2-y1)) directly. This suggests the student thinks complex expressions need to be 'broken down' into simpler pieces rather than trusting the language to evaluate them.",
          "error_manifestation": "No runtime error or incorrect output\u2014the code executes correctly and produces the right answer. However, the approach suggests incomplete understanding of expression evaluation and operator precedence in Java.",
