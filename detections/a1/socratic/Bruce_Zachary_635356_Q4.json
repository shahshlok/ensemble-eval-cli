When the user enters '00' followed by a newline, `x.nextDouble()` on line 7 consumes '0'. The very next call, `x.nextDouble()` on line 8, attempts to read the next token. In the sample run context where the input is '00' on one line, this is potentially risky or non-portable, as standard input buffering might queue the input differently. However, based on the *successful* sample run output (12.5), the student's code relies on the first input '00' being tokenized as two separate 0s, and '50' as 5 and 0, and '05' as 0 and 5, due to how `nextDouble()` consumes numerical tokens separated potentially only by the lack of other delimiters in successive calls, or by how the IDE/environment handles the input stream when inputs are tightly concatenated.",
