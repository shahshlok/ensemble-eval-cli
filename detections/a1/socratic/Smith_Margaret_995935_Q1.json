          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that variables can have undefined or problematic states, and that explicitly checking for invalid input (like division by zero) and initializing variables to a 'safe' default is the primary way to handle computation.",
          "conceptual_gap": "While the student correctly identifies that division by zero is problematic, they've chosen to initialize `n` to 0 and only compute it conditionally. This suggests a mental model where: (1) variables must be 'pre-initialized' before use, and (2) the program should silently handle edge cases by returning a default value rather than either trusting valid input or explicitly communicating an error. In this specific problem, the formula is straightforward and the student should compute `n = y/t` directly; the defensive check is unnecessary given the problem constraints.",
          "error_manifestation": "The code produces correct output for valid inputs (matching the sample run), but the defensive programming pattern suggests the student may not fully trust the computational model or may be overly cautious about edge cases that the problem doesn't require handling.",

The mental model appears to treat each variable assignment as a 'checkpoint' that must be verified before proceeding, rather than recognizing that `(v1-v0)/t` is a single, valid, compositional expression. This isn't incorrect per se, but indicates incomplete understanding of expression composition.",

          "conceptual_gap": "While guarding against $t=0$ is mathematically correct, the student introduces an unnecessary variable `n` initialized to 0 (Line 10) and then assigns the result conditionally (Line 11). If `t` is 0, the output will correctly be 0, but the direct formula application using a single line `double n = (v1-v0)/t;` would be clearer, assuming the assignment takes place regardless of the variable initial state if $t \neq 0$. The approach demonstrates a slightly convoluted assignment structure, possibly stemming from an over-cautious or unfamiliar approach to variable initialization and conditional execution, or perhaps anticipating `t` might be 0, which is physically irrelevant for average acceleration calculation but mathematically possible. In this specific context, it's structurally inefficient but functionally correct.",
