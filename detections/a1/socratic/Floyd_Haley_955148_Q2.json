They feel compelled to define variables for every input component, even if the variable 'b' is a redundant alias for an already defined variable, to structure the final calculation as exactly 'c = a * b'.",

Creating an alias variable (`b`) that holds the exact same value as an existing, well-named variable (`pricePerGallonInDollars`) is unnecessary overhead and reduces code clarity. The computer does not need this algebraic scaffolding to perform the final calculation.",
