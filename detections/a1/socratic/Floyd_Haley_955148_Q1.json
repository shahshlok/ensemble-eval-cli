They view variables like `finalVelocityV1` not as reusable computational entities, but as inputs that must first be mapped to algebraic placeholders to perform the required computation steps.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java (and most imperative languages), expressions can be calculated directly using descriptive variable names. Introducing sequential assignments to generic aliases (`a`, `b`, `c`) for variables already holding values is redundant and inefficient, as the expression `(finalVelocityV1 - startingVelocityV0) / timeT` provides the same result in a single, clearer step. The Java notional machine evaluates expressions based on variable values, not on a requirement for algebraic placeholders.",
