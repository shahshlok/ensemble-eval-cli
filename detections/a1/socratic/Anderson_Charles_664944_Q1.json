The student's high degree of decomposition suggests a mental model where the computer can only execute simple, single-operator operations per line, leading to the use of redundant variables.",

The student may not fully grasp that complex expressions can be evaluated atomically, or they may believe that the computer needs each step explicitly spelled out as separate variables to 'understand' the math. In reality, Java can evaluate `(v1 - v0) / t` directly without intermediate storage, and doing so is clearer and more aligned with the mathematical formula presented in the problem.",
