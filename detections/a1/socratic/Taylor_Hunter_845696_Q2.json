They appear to treat Java like a procedural calculator where only one operation can happen per line/variable assignment, leading to the redundant final step `double cost = b;`.",
          "conceptual_gap": "Java handles linear expressions of arbitrary complexity using precedence rules. The entire calculation could have been performed and assigned in a single step using descriptive variable names (e.g., `double cost = distance / mpg * price_per_gallon;`). The use of temporary, non-descriptive variables (`a`, `b`) followed by a final, redundant assignment to `cost` indicates a failure to leverage Java's expression parsing capabilities.",

          "conceptual_gap": "While this isn't technically wrong (the code executes correctly), it reveals a potential misconception about variable scope and computational efficiency. The student may not fully grasp that variables are just containers for values, and that `double cost = b;` followed by `double b = a * price_per_gallon;` creates unnecessary copies rather than meaningful computational steps. This suggests the student may not understand that you can compute the result directly in one expression, or that assigning to another variable doesn't add semantic value.",
