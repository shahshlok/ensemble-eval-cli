Introducing an intermediate variable `b` (via `b=t;`) only to hold the same value as `t` increases code verbosity and redundancy, suggesting the student is mapping the formula components (Numerator/Denominator) too rigidly onto separate variables without utilizing the direct expressiveness of Java expressions.",
