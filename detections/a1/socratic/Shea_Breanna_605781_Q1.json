          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that using longer, more descriptive variable names (like `v1_value` and `t_time`) makes the code clearer or somehow changes how the program operates, rather than understanding that variable names are just identifiers.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student appears to conflate variable naming conventions with functional behavior. While `v1_value` and `t_time` are more descriptive than `v1` and `t`, they are semantically identical to the computer. The choice of name doesn't affect program logic, only readability. The student may not fully grasp that variable names are arbitrary labels\u2014what matters is the data stored, not the name chosen.",
          "error_manifestation": "No runtime error or incorrect output occurs, but the code pattern suggests the student may be using variable naming as a form of 'self-documentation' rather than understanding that naming is purely for human readability. This could indicate incomplete mastery of the distinction between variable identity and variable purpose.",
