          "conceptual_gap": "While breaking down complex formulas can improve readability in some cases, the student has created variables `a` and `b` that directly mirror the formula components without adding semantic meaning. The student doesn't recognize that `a = v1 - v0` and `b = t` are temporary holders that could be eliminated by computing the expression directly: `double average_acceleration = (v1 - v0) / t;`. This suggests the student may not fully understand that expressions can be computed inline, or believes each step must be stored in a named variable.",

In Java, variable names should be meaningful. The student doesn't appear to understand that maintaining consistent, descriptive naming\u2014even for temporary variables\u2014is a best practice that reflects code quality and maintainability.
