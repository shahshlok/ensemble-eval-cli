They treat variable assignment as an essential step for sequential calculation rather than recognizing the capability of nested expression evaluation.",
          "conceptual_gap": "Java, like most programming languages, allows for complex expressions to be evaluated and nested into a single statement (e.g., `double h = Math.sqrt((a-x)*(a-x) + (b-y)*(b-y));`). The necessity of explicit intermediate variables (`c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`) reflects a mental model where the computer's memory only operates on one assigned variable at a time, failing to grasp how the compiler and expression stack handle temporary, unnamed results efficiently.",

The student doesn't recognize that intermediate results can be computed inline within expressions without needing explicit intermediate variables.
