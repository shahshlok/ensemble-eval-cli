          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, variable names are arbitrary identifiers that have no semantic meaning to the compiler or runtime. The student appears to think that using inconsistent names (x1, y1_val, x2_val, y2) will somehow help the computer understand the intent, when in reality, the computer only cares about which variables are used in which operations. The student may also believe that the variable names should 'match' the prompts, showing a misunderstanding that prompts are just text output and don't constrain variable naming.",
          "error_manifestation": "No runtime error or wrong output occurs because the code is technically correct\u2014the calculations use the right variables. However, this reveals confused thinking about the relationship between variable names, prompts, and program semantics.",

          "conceptual_gap": "While variable naming is a style choice, the inconsistency here (x1, y1_val, x2_val, y2) suggests the student may not fully understand that all four values play the same role in the formula: they are all coordinate components. The student's mental model treats them as somehow different entities rather than symmetric components of two points.",
