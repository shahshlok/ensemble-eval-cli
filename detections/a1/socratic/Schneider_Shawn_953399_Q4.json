They think the semantic meaning of a variable in the context of the distance formula automatically carries through to the area formula context.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, variable names are just labels for memory locations. When the student writes `double a = s;` on line 34, the variable `a` is simply assigned the value of `s` at that moment. There is no automatic connection between this `a` and the geometric concept of 'side1' that should appear in Heron's formula. The student appears to conflate the mathematical notation in the problem statement (where letters represent specific quantities) with Java variable semantics. In the formula area = \u221a[s(s-side1)(s-side2)(s-side3)], the four factors should use the three sides, not reintroduced variables a, b, c, d.",
          "error_manifestation": "The program will compile and run, but produce incorrect output. The area calculation uses `a * b * c * d` where a=s, b=s-side1, c=s-side2, d=s-side3. This is actually correct mathematically, but the naming suggests the student may not understand they're computing the right formula. The deeper misconception is about whether the variable names carry semantic meaning versus just being labels.",

          "conceptual_gap": "While introducing intermediate variables can aid readability, the student's approach here obscures the formula rather than clarifying it. The Heron's formula components (s, s-side1, s-side2, s-side3) are directly related to the triangle sides, but the student names them a, b, c, d\u2014generic names that don't reflect their mathematical meaning. This suggests the student may not fully grasp that variable names should communicate intent and meaning, not just serve as placeholders.",

However, this shows they may have initially been unsure about type conversion rules and needed to 'force' the result to be double.",
          "conceptual_gap": "While the student's code is correct here, the explicit use of `2.0` suggests they may not fully understand Java's type promotion rules. If both operands in a division are integers, the result is an integer (truncating division). Since at least one operand is a double (`side1 + side2 + side3` is already a double from the sqrt calculations), Java would promote the division to double automatically. The student may believe they must always explicitly use decimal notation to ensure double arithmetic, rather than understanding automatic type promotion.",

          "conceptual_gap": "The student confuses the visual layout of the sample input `(x1, y1):00` with the technical requirement of input tokenization. `Scanner.nextInt()` reads the *next* complete integer token, which must typically be separated by whitespace (space, tab, or newline). If a user enters '00', Java normally treats this as the single integer 10 (or 00 which is 0) or potentially throws an input mismatch error if it expects two tokens but only receives one, demonstrating a misunderstanding of how the scanner consumes tokens delimited by whitespace.",
