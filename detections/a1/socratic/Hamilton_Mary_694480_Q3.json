          "conceptual_gap": "While this isn't a runtime error, it reveals a misconception about what 'good programming' means. The student appears to not yet understand that variable names should be semantically meaningful to aid human comprehension. In Java, clarity and maintainability are valued alongside correctness. The student treats variable naming as arbitrary rather than as a tool for communication.",
