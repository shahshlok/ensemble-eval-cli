          "conceptual_gap": "In Java (and most programming languages), intermediate results do not necessarily require separate named variables. The entire calculation `(v1 - v0) / t` can be directly assigned to the final acceleration variable. While syntactically correct, the student's approach suggests a lack of understanding regarding operator precedence and the expressiveness of compound expressions in Java, implying they view the computation largely as a sequence of single arithmetic operations.",
