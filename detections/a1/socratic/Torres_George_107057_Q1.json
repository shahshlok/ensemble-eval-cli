          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that they have correctly implemented the acceleration formula a = (v1 - v0) / t by first calculating the numerator (v1 - v0) and storing it in variable 'a', then dividing by t.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student has misunderstood the mathematical notation and the formula structure. They calculated only the change in velocity (v1 - v0) and assigned it to 'a', but the formula requires dividing this change by time in a single operation. While their code does eventually divide by t on the next line, the intermediate variable 'a' stores the velocity difference, not acceleration. The gap is semantic: the variable name 'a' suggests acceleration, but it temporarily holds a velocity value. More critically, the student may not fully grasp that 'a = v1 - v0' alone is incomplete\u2014it represents change in velocity, not acceleration. The complete formula must divide this difference by time.",
          "error_manifestation": "The code actually produces the correct output by coincidence of the two-step calculation. However, the misconception reveals itself in the variable naming and logical structure: using 'a' for an intermediate velocity calculation is conceptually wrong, even though the final result is mathematically correct due to the subsequent division.",
