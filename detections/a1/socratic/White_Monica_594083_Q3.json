          "conceptual_gap": "While the student's approach of using multiplication (a * a) is actually correct and produces the right result, it suggests the student may not know that Java has no built-in exponentiation operator for general use (^ is bitwise XOR, not power). However, the student compensated well by using multiplication. The conceptual gap is whether the student understands WHY this works or simply copied a pattern. The code works correctly, but it reveals uncertainty about mathematical operators in Java.",
