          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that simple arithmetic operations used in a linear sequence must each be assigned to a unique intermediate variable before the final calculation can occur, similar to how one might solve a multi-step problem in a notebook (Step 1: calculate numerator, Step 2: calculate denominator/reassign, Step 3: calculate quotient). They may view intermediate results as requiring separate storage unnecessarily.",

This indicates a highly procedural, atomic view of mathematical syntax.",
