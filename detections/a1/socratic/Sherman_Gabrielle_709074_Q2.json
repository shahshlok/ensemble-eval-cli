This suggests a mental separation between descriptive 'input storage' variables and concise 'calculation symbols,' mimicking algebraic conventions.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, once a variable (e.g., `distance_miles`) is initialized with a value, it serves as the definitive reference for that value throughout its scope. There is no notional requirement to 'remap' or copy descriptive variable names to shorter ones for use in calculations. The code, for example, could directly use `double cost = (distance_miles / mpg) * price_per_gallon;` without introducing unnecessary intermediate variables, which are redundant in the Java execution model.",

The student has already named variables descriptively (distance_miles, mpg, price_per_gallon) but then creates aliases with single letters.

The student may think that single-letter variables are required for mathematical operations, or that renaming improves performance or understanding.",
