          "conceptual_gap": "The student has misread or misunderstood Heron's formula. The correct formula is: area = \u221a[s(s-side1)(s-side2)(s-side3)], which means the product should be s multiplied by (s-side1), (s-side2), and (s-side3). However, the student is computing p1 * p2 * p3 * p4 where p1=s, p2=(s-side1), p3=(s-side2), p4=(s-side3). This treats all four terms as independent factors in a symmetric product. The student appears to have computed the formula as if it were \u221a[s \u00d7 (s-side1) \u00d7 (s-side2) \u00d7 (s-side3)] correctly, but the variable naming (p1, p2, p3, p4) suggests uncertainty about which terms to multiply.",
