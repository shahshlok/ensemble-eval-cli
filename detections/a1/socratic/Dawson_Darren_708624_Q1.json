          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that calculating (v1 - v0) and then dividing by t in separate steps is equivalent to implementing the formula a = (v1 - v0) / t, without recognizing that the intermediate variable 'a' should represent the complete numerator before division.",
          "conceptual_gap": "While the student's code is technically correct and produces the right output, the naming and structure suggest a potential misunderstanding of the formula. The variable 'a' is assigned (v1 - v0) first, then used in a separate operation. This works due to operator precedence and order of operations, but the student may not fully grasp that the formula requires the entire (v1 - v0) to be treated as a single unit in the numerator before division occurs. A more direct implementation would be: double averageAcceleration = (v1 - v0) / t; This reveals whether the student understands the mathematical structure or is just following a step-by-step mechanical process.",
          "error_manifestation": "No runtime error or incorrect output in this case - the code produces the correct result (18.266666666666666). However, the intermediate variable assignment suggests the student may not fully understand operator precedence and may struggle with more complex formulas.",
