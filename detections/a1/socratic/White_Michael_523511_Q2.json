          "conceptual_gap": "While using meaningful variable names is good practice, the student appears to conflate 'clarity through intermediate steps' with actual code necessity. The student doesn't recognize that direct assignment (e.g., `costOfDrivingInDollars = gallonsNeededForTrip * pricePerGallonInDollars;`) is equally clear and more efficient. The mental model seems to suggest that breaking down a calculation into multiple temporary variables improves understanding, when in fact the mathematical formula is already clear from context.",

In a real-world road trip calculator, miles per gallon will never realistically be zero\u2014it's not a likely user error that needs handling.

While initialization is required, assigning `0.0` to a variable just before assigning a calculated value to it, or using an unnecessary temporary variable (like `temporaryCostHolder`) to hold an intermediate result for a single step, suggests a lack of understanding regarding how compound expressions are evaluated and assigned in a single statement.
