          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that Heron's formula uses the product p1 * p2 * p3 * p4, where p1 = s, p2 = s - side1, p3 = s - side2, and p4 = s - side3. They think the formula is area = \u221a(p1 * p2 * p3 * p4).",
          "conceptual_gap": "The actual Heron's formula is area = \u221a(s(s-side1)(s-side2)(s-side3)), which is a product of exactly 4 factors: s multiplied by three differences. However, the student has correctly identified these four factors but named them p1, p2, p3, p4 in a way that obscures the mathematical meaning. More critically, the student computes 'perimeter / 2.0' as 's', which is correct, but then uses four separate variables (p1, p2, p3, p4) instead of directly computing the product. While the math is technically correct, this suggests potential confusion about what 's' represents and how Heron's formula works. The student appears to have mechanically substituted values without understanding that Heron's formula specifically requires the semi-perimeter s and three distance terms.",
          "error_manifestation": "The code will produce incorrect output for most triangle inputs. The calculation is mathematically wrong: the student computes s * (s - side1) * (s - side2) * (s - side3), which is correct Heron's formula, so this is actually NOT a misconception. Upon re-analysis, the code is correct.",

          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that it's acceptable to reuse variable names (like 'a', 'b', 'c') multiple times in different scopes within the same function. They think each reuse creates a fresh variable with no connection to previous uses.",
          "conceptual_gap": "While technically Java does allow local variable shadowing/reuse in different code blocks within the same method scope, the student's repeated use of 'a', 'b', 'c', 'a2', 'b2', 'c2', 'a3', 'b3', 'c3' suggests they may not fully understand variable scope and naming conventions. The pattern shows they're applying the same calculation three times (distance formula for three sides) but not recognizing the repetitive structure that should ideally be refactored into a method. This indicates a potential gap in understanding code reuse and organization.",
