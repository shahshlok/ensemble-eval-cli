          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that checking if a value is >= 0.0 before taking its square root is necessary for the sqrt() function to work, and that negative or zero values need special handling in the distance calculation.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student doesn't fully understand that Math.sqrt() can handle zero values correctly (returning 0.0). The check `if (sum >= 0.0)` is redundant because sum is mathematically always >= 0 (it's the sum of two squared values). More importantly, the student initializes result to 0.0 and only updates it if the condition is true, suggesting a misunderstanding that Math.sqrt() might fail or behave unexpectedly. In reality, Math.sqrt(0) returns 0.0 without issue, and since dx\u00b2 + dy\u00b2 is always non-negative, the condition always evaluates to true, making the check pointless.",

          "conceptual_gap": "While the student is correct that negative values would cause Math.sqrt() to return NaN, they don't recognize that for a valid triangle, Heron's formula always produces a non-negative product. The check `if (product > 0.0)` suggests the student is protecting against invalid triangles, which is reasonable for robustness. However, the else clause setting area = 0.0 is redundant since area was already initialized to 0.0 on line 40. More importantly, the student may not fully understand when this situation would actually occur (degenerate triangles), indicating some uncertainty about the mathematical properties of valid triangles.",
