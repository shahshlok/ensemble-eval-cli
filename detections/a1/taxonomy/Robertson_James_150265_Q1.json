          "conceptual_gap": "The student uses unnecessary initialization (Line 23) and intermediate temporary variables (Line 20, Line 28) for a calculation that could be done in a single line (or two, including the initialization, Line 23). While syntactically correct, this pattern suggests a lack of trust in standard sequential execution or overly cautious defensive programming, indicating they may not fully grasp how simple expressions are evaluated and assigned directly. Specifically, initializing `averageAcceleration` to 0.0 (Line 23) is redundant given the structure of the `if` block and the fact that 0.0 is precisely the value it should hold if `timeIntervalT` is zero.",
