          "student_thought_process": "The student believes complex formulas must be broken down into the smallest possible intermediate steps, potentially assigning each term or sub-expression to a separate variable (a, b, c) before combining them. This suggests a step-by-step sequential processing model where variables are primarily used as temporary storage for single mathematical operations, rather than understanding that Java can evaluate complex compound expressions in a single statement.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The gap is the failure to recognize that Java\u2019s execution model handles compound expressions and operator precedence automatically, making the use of excessive temporary variables (a, b, c) completely unnecessary for readability, correctness, or execution flow. The expression `c = (v1 - v0) / t` is semantically equivalent and far cleaner.",
