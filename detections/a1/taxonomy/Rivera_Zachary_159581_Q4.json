          "conceptual_gap": "In algebraic notation, the visual layout (a sum over a horizontal fraction bar) implies that the entire numerator is divided by the denominator, even if no explicit parentheses are written. In Java, however, expressions are evaluated according to fixed operator precedence and associativity rules: multiplication and division are performed before addition and subtraction. Thus, in `sideOneLength + sideTwoLength + sideThreeLength / 2.0`, only `sideThreeLength` is divided by 2, and then that result is added to the other two sides. The student's mental model treats Java as if it understood the \"top over bottom\" structure of the written formula, rather than a linear sequence of operators with defined precedence.",
