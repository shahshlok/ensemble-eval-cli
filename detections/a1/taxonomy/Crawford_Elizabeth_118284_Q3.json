          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that using different variable names (x1, y1_val, x2_val, y2) doesn't matter as long as they perform the correct mathematical operations, because the variable names are just labels and don't affect the computation.",
          "conceptual_gap": "While variable names are indeed just labels, the student has created a mismatch between the problem's conceptual structure and the code's variable assignments. The problem defines two points: (x1, y1) and (x2, y2). The student reads x1 correctly but then reads into y1_val, then reads into x2_val instead of x2, and finally reads into y2. This creates a confusing mapping where the variable names don't reflect their semantic role, making the code harder to verify and suggesting the student may not have a clear mental model of which variable represents which coordinate.",
          "error_manifestation": "No compile error or runtime exception; the code produces correct output despite the inconsistent naming. However, the inconsistency indicates a potential conceptual weakness in understanding variable roles.",
