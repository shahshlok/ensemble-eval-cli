They also seem to believe that using the same Scanner variable throughout the program is straightforward, without recognizing potential naming conflicts.",
          "conceptual_gap": "While this code is technically correct and will execute, it demonstrates a misconception about code clarity and variable naming conventions. The scanner is named 'x', which conflicts semantically with the coordinate variables x1, x2, x3. Additionally, the student may not fully understand that the Scanner object 'x' is a reference to an input stream, not a coordinate value. This naming scheme could lead to confusion about what 'x' represents in different contexts.",
          "error_manifestation": "The code will produce correct output, but this is a code quality/clarity issue rather than a runtime error. However, if the student were to make a mistake (e.g., trying to use 'x' as a coordinate variable later), it would cause confusion or errors.",
