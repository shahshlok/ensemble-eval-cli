          "conceptual_gap": "The student's approach to parsing coordinates (lines 27-79) is extremely brittle and based on incorrect assumptions about user input format. Specifically, using `substring(0, 1)` captures only the first character for the first coordinate (x1, x2, x3), regardless of whether the coordinate is single or multi-digit, and `substring(1)` captures the rest for the second coordinate (y1, y2, y3). For the sample input `00`, `50`, and `05`, this works coincidentally because all coordinates are single digits ('0', '0' and '5', '0' and '0', '5'). If the user enters `12 34` (two inputs separated by a space) or `1050` (a four-digit coordinate pair), the parsing logic will fail to correctly segment or convert the numbers, as it assumes the first character is x, and everything after is y.",
