The check `if (sumOfSquaredDifferencesValue >= 0.0)` is therefore unnecessary\u2014the condition will always be true.

In Java's floating-point system, squaring any real number (`double`) always results in a positive number (or zero), and the sum of two non-negative numbers will always be non-negative. This check indicates a misunderstanding or lack of confidence in the basic mathematical properties enforced by the execution model (specifically, that a sum of squares cannot be negative).
