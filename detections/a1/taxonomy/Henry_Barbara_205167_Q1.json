More importantly, the student seems unaware that in a normal execution flow with user input, the `hasNextDouble()` calls will all succeed sequentially. The real issue is that this defensive pattern is masking the actual logic\u2014the code works by accident because all three tokens are present, but the student's mental model treats input validation as essential rather than optional.",
