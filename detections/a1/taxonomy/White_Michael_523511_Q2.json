          "conceptual_gap": "Java handles complex expressions efficiently. The use of `temporaryCostHolder` followed immediately by assigning its value to `costOfDrivingInDollars` is redundant. It reflects a mental model where arithmetic steps must be rigidly isolated in sequential temporary registers before reaching the final destination, rather than understanding that a calculation can be assigned directly: `costOfDrivingInDollars = gallonsNeededForTrip * pricePerGallonInDollars;`",
