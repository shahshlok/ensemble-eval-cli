          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, integer division by zero throws an ArithmeticException and does crash at runtime, but floating\u2011point division by zero (with double or float) does not throw an exception. Instead, Java follows IEEE\u2011754 semantics and produces special values such as Infinity, -Infinity, or NaN. The student's mental model treats all numeric division uniformly as potentially crashing, missing the distinction between integer arithmetic and floating\u2011point arithmetic in the Java execution model.",
          "error_manifestation": "No immediate bug in this program, but the student would mispredict behavior in cases like double division by zero (expecting a crash instead of Infinity/NaN), which could lead to unnecessary checks or incorrect handling in other contexts.",
