The square of any real number is non-negative, and the sum of non-negative numbers is non-negative. This is a mathematical invariant that cannot be violated, even with floating-point precision issues. The defensive check is both unnecessary and demonstrates a misunderstanding of the mathematical properties of the formula being implemented.",
