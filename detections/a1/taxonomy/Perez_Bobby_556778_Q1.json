They think using v, y, n, a, b for v0, v1, t, and the intermediate/final calculations is acceptable because the computer only cares about the order of inputs, not semantic meaning.",
          "conceptual_gap": "While Java does allow arbitrary variable names, the student has failed to recognize that meaningful variable names are crucial for code correctness verification and maintainability. More importantly, using confusing names (a, b, v, y, n instead of v0, v1, t, acceleration) makes it harder to map the code back to the formula and increases the likelihood of logical errors. The student's approach obscures the mathematical relationship a = (v1 - v0) / t.",

They think this is defensive programming, but they've applied it without understanding the actual requirements or error handling philosophy.",
          "conceptual_gap": "While checking for division by zero is sometimes reasonable, in this physics problem the time t should never be zero (it's a physical impossibility). The student has inserted defensive code that masks the actual intent of the formula and introduces a silent failure mode: if n=0, the program outputs 0 as the acceleration instead of either throwing an error or handling it explicitly. This is different from the expected behavior and suggests the student doesn't fully understand when defensive programming is appropriate.",

They treat variable names primarily as necessary placeholders rather than mnemonic aids that improve readability and prevent logical errors based on identity.",
          "conceptual_gap": "While Java doesn't enforce naming conventions, a fundamental part of programming involves mapping real-world or mathematical variables to clear, descriptive program identifiers. The student randomly chose 'v', 'y', and 'n' for $v_0$, $v_1$, and $t$.

The use of an auxiliary variable `b` and initialization to 0 (Line 11) is part of setting up this structure unnecessarily.",
