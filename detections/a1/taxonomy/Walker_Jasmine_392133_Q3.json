While floating-point numbers have precision issues, the sum of two results from `double * double` multiplication is guaranteed to be non-negative (unless inputs/outputs deal with NaN or Infinity, which the check doesn't handle anyway).

While floating-point errors (like `NaN` or small negative results near zero due to precision limits) do exist, explicitly checking for `sumOfSquaredDifferences < 0` to avoid issues with `Math.sqrt` suggests a misunderstanding of Java's robustness and the mathematical context, especially since `Math.sqrt` handles small negative values near zero gracefully or returns `NaN` for truly negative values if they occurred.",
