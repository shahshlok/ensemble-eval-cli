          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that variables defined directly via user input (`startingVelocityInput`) are inherently volatile or risky to use in complex calculations, or that creating copies (`startingVelocityValue`) isolates the calculation logic from the input process, improving robustness or clarity beyond what is necessary for simple variable assignment.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student does not fully grasp the concept of simple variable assignment and how Java manages primitive types (doubles). In Java, once a value is read into `startingVelocityInput`, that variable holds a static value. Assigning it to `startingVelocityValue` (e.g., `double startingVelocityValue = startingVelocityInput;`) is a copy operation that is functionally redundant for this task, as the original input variables are not modified later, nor are they conceptually different from the 'value' variables they are copied into.",

This suggests a fear of uninitialized variables or a misunderstanding of flow control's guarantee of assignment.",
          "conceptual_gap": "While initializing variables is generally good practice, C-style primitive initialization like `double averageAccelerationResult = 0.0;` is often unnecessary when the calculation path (lines 28-36) ensures the variable is assigned a meaningful value before it is used (line 40). In a structure where the final variable assignment is guaranteed, the initial assignment is conceptually redundant, reflecting a cautious but unnecessary adherence to an enforced rule or default behavior pattern.",
