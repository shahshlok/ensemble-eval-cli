There is no requirement in the Java execution model to copy `finalVelocityV1` to `b` and `timeT` to `a` before performing the calculation. The student's model introduces unnecessary complexity by treating the named input variables as restricted resources that must be proxied by single-letter, generic variables for computation.",
