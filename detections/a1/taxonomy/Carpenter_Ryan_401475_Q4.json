          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that once a variable is assigned a value, it can be reused with a different meaning in the same scope without confusion. The student uses 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd' as intermediate variables for the Heron's formula calculation, seemingly unaware that 'a1', 'a2', 'a3', 'b1', 'b2', 'b3' were already used for coordinate differences.",
          "conceptual_gap": "While the code is technically correct (variable names don't have to be unique across different contexts), the reuse of single-letter variable names 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd' for the Heron's formula components demonstrates poor naming practice and suggests the student may not fully understand scope and variable naming conventions. More importantly, the student computes 'a = s' (line 31) when the Heron's formula requires multiplying s * (s-side1) * (s-side2) * (s-side3), but instead uses separate variables. This could indicate confusion about whether intermediate calculations should be stored separately or computed inline.",
          "error_manifestation": "The code produces mathematically correct output for the given sample input, but the variable naming and decomposition pattern suggests the student may have misconceptualized how to structure the formula computation. The assignment 'a = s' (line 31) is semantically odd\u2014it suggests the student might think 'a' represents something other than its actual role, or simply chose poor variable names without understanding their purpose.",

If a user enters input in a format that doesn't match the expected type, a runtime exception occurs. The sample input format '00', '50', '05' suggests the student may not have tested with actual user input or fully understood input parsing requirements.",
