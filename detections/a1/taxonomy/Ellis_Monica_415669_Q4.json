          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that variables with similar purposes but different names (side1, side_2, Side3) are interchangeable and that case sensitivity and naming conventions don't matter for correctness, as long as they reference the same conceptual value.",
          "conceptual_gap": "Java is case-sensitive and treats 'side_2' and 'Side3' as completely distinct variables from 'side1'. While the code happens to work because all three variables are initialized and used consistently, the student demonstrates a lack of understanding that variable names are exact identifiers. This suggests a mental model where variable naming is purely cosmetic rather than semantically significant. If the student had made a typo (e.g., using 'side_2' where 'Side3' was intended), the code would fail, but the student may not recognize this as a critical error.",
