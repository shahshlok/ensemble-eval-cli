          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, a variable name can only refer to one entity within a given scope. The student created a Scanner object named 'x' on line 4, but then uses 'x.nextDouble()' throughout the code. While this works syntactically, it demonstrates a lack of understanding that 'x' is bound to the Scanner object. Using 'x' as a variable name shows the student doesn't recognize the naming conflict conceptually. This suggests the student views variable names as flexible labels rather than unique identifiers bound to specific objects in memory.",
          "error_manifestation": "No compile error or runtime exception occurs in this case, but the code quality is poor and indicates conceptual confusion. The choice of 'x' for the Scanner object is confusing because the variable x1, x2, x3 are coordinate values\u2014completely different in meaning from the input Scanner. This naming demonstrates the student hasn't internalized that variables represent distinct memory locations with specific semantic meanings.",

However, they've already computed 's' as the semi-perimeter on line 12. The code on line 13 uses this correctly: Math.sqrt(s*(s-s1)*(s-s2)*(s-s3)), which is mathematically sound. Upon closer inspection, the student actually DID implement this correctly.

The student used 'y' to store the area, when 'area' would be semantically clear. This demonstrates the student may not fully appreciate that variable names serve as documentation of a variable's purpose. More critically, using 'y' (typically associated with a y-coordinate) for an area value suggests the student hasn't internalized the principle that variable names should reflect their semantic role.
