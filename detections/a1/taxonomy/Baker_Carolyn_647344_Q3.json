They likely think they are explicitly covering the two different cases (zero vs non-zero) and that this conditional structure is necessary for correct or safe execution.",

The condition `sum_val != 0.0 || sum_val == 0.0` is a tautology: for any finite `double` value, exactly one of these comparisons is true, so the whole expression is always true. The notional machine issue is that the student does not reason about the expression as a single boolean value over all inputs; instead, they seem to treat it as a list of separate checks that the computer will apply in some protective or special way. In reality, this if-statement never blocks execution of the body and is equivalent to just executing `distance = Math.sqrt(sum_val);` unconditionally.",

This means the body of the if will always execute, exactly as if there were no if-statement. If the student intended to prevent taking the square root of a negative number (or to skip the computation in some case), the correct condition would need to distinguish those cases (e.g., sum_val >= 0).
