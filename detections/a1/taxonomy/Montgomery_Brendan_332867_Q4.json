The prompt is just text for the user\u2014it doesn't instruct the Scanner about which variables to fill. The code correctly reads two values in sequence (a and b), but this happens to work only because the user is expected to follow the prompt order. The Scanner has no awareness of the prompt content.",
          "error_manifestation": "The code works correctly for the given sample input, but demonstrates a flawed mental model. If a user enters values in a different order or format than the prompt suggests, the student would likely be confused about why the program doesn't 'understand' the intended mapping.",

The student seems to believe that because they know what each variable means (x1, y1, x2, y2, etc.), the code is 'readable.'

          "conceptual_gap": "The gap is between algebraic notation (where single letters are meaningful within a formula's context) and software engineering practice. In Java, meaningful identifiers are critical for readability and matching code to algorithmic steps (e.g., using `x1`, `y1`, `sideAB`, `semiPerimeter` or `area`). The student's model assumes the computer or a human reader can map these variables mentally based on order of appearance or mathematical context, which quickly breaks down as the code grows, concealing the semantic meaning of variables like `i`, `l`, and `o` being side lengths, and `p` being the semi-perimeter.",
