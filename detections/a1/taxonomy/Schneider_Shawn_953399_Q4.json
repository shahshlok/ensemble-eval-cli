          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that when int variables (x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3) are assigned to double variables or used in arithmetic with doubles, they are automatically converted to their exact double representations without loss of precision, and that the final calculation will preserve decimal accuracy throughout.",
          "conceptual_gap": "While Java does perform automatic widening conversion from int to double, the student has already lost precision by reading the input as int. The sample input '00', '50', '05' suggests coordinates like (0,0), (5,0), (0,5), which should be read as doubles from the start to match the expected output of 12.5. By reading as int first, the student truncates any decimal input the user might provide, then converts to double\u2014but the damage is already done. Additionally, the student may not fully understand that int arithmetic happens first, then converts to double.",
          "error_manifestation": "Wrong output - while the code will run and produce a number, it will fail to handle cases where users intend to input decimal coordinates. For the sample run provided, it happens to work because (0,0), (5,0), (0,5) are already integers, but the design is fundamentally flawed for general triangle problems.",

The student thinks assigning intermediate results to separate variables a, b, c, d (which represent s-side1, s-side2, s-side3 respectively) is clearer than inline computation, without realizing this adds no semantic value and potentially obscures the relationship to the formula.",
          "conceptual_gap": "While intermediate variables can improve readability, the student's naming choice (a, b, c, d) does not match standard mathematical convention for Heron's formula. The formula is area = \u221a(s(s-side1)(s-side2)(s-side3)), and the intermediate variables should represent these differences. The student's use of single letters (a, b, c, d) without clear meaning makes the code harder to verify against the formula, not easier. This suggests a misconception that variable naming automatically documents intent.",
