          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that variables defined using simple mathematical differences (a, b, c, d, e, f) are sufficient to calculate the side lengths, possibly confusing programming variables with intermediate steps in a mathematical proof or calculation plan. They do not seem to recognize that the intermediate steps 'a' through 'f' are only necessary components of the distance formula, not the formula itself, thus cluttering the variable space unnecessarily and potentially misrepresenting the formula structure.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, one should strive for clarity and efficiency. While defining six intermediate variables (a through f) to calculate three Euclidean distances (side1, side2, side3) is syntactically correct, it demonstrates a failure to map the distance formula (which requires squared differences) directly to a concise variable structure. The student calculates differences (e.g., `a=x2-x1;`), and then uses them immediately (`side1=Math.sqrt(a*a+b*b);`). This structure suggests a fragmented idea of computation rather than a complete mathematical expression.",
