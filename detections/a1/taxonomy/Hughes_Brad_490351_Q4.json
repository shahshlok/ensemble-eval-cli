          "conceptual_gap": "While the code is actually correct in its mathematical implementation, the use of single-letter variable names (a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i) for different mathematical quantities suggests the student views variables as temporary computational placeholders rather than meaningful representations of geometric concepts (like 'side1', 'side2', 'side3'). This indicates a potential gap in connecting the mathematical problem domain to code representation.",
