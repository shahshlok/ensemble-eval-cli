          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, variable names must be unique within the same scope. The student declares 'Scanner x' on line 4, then attempts to use 'x1' for the x-coordinate. However, the reuse of 'x' as a Scanner object and the naming pattern suggests the student may not fully understand variable scope and naming conventions. More critically, the student should recognize that Scanner variables and coordinate variables serve different purposes and should have semantically distinct names to avoid confusion.",
          "error_manifestation": "While this code will compile and run, it represents poor naming practice and conceptual confusion. The variable naming is misleading\u2014using 'x' for a Scanner object is unconventional and creates cognitive burden.",

If this condition is violated, the expression under the square root in Heron's formula becomes negative or zero, resulting in NaN or invalid output. The student has not implemented validation to check whether the input points actually form a valid triangle.",

          "conceptual_gap": "The execution model of Java's `Scanner.nextDouble()` is procedural: it consumes the next token regardless of whether the user is typing complex input (like '00' in the sample run for x1 and y1, which means 0 then 0, or 0 space 0). The student's code is correct in reading the data types, but it violates good user experience practices by coupling multiple input reads (lines 10 & 11, 13 & 14, 16 & 17) to a single prompt (lines 9, 12, 15), relying completely on the user's implicit understanding of how to separate paired inputs.",
          "error_manifestation": "Poor user experience/Instruction ambiguity. If the user doesn't know to input two numbers per prompt, the program might wait indefinitely or read inputs incorrectly if they provide them on separate lines and expect an 'Enter' key press to correspond to the next prompt, which never arrives.",
