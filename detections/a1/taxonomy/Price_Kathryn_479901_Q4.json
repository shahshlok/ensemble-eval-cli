The prompt is merely a guide for the human user; the code itself doesn't 'read' the prompt to determine which variable gets which value. However, in this case, the code is actually correct\u2014it does read x1, then y1 in sequence, matching the prompt. The student's implementation happens to align with the expected behavior, but may reflect a misconception about *why* it works (i.e., assuming the prompt 'drives' the input parsing rather than understanding sequential token consumption).",
