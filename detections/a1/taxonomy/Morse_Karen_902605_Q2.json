          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, variables are memory locations used to store results of imperative commands. Introducing redundant variables, such as 'c', which is explicitly assigned the value of 'b' only for symbolic purposes, is unnecessary and reveals a mental model rooted in algebraic symbolic decomposition rather than effective procedural computation. The calculation could be completed with just one result variable.",
