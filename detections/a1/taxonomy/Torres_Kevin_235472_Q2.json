The student may think this intermediate step serves a purpose (like validation, processing, or maintaining separate 'input' and 'working' versions), but it's functionally identical to directly using `distanceInput`. This suggests a misunderstanding of variable scope and assignment semantics\u2014the student may believe variables need to be 'transformed' through intermediate assignments rather than being used directly.",
          "error_manifestation": "The code produces correct output, but the unnecessary intermediate variables indicate confused thinking about variable usage and suggest the student doesn't fully understand that assignment simply copies a value without any special processing.",
