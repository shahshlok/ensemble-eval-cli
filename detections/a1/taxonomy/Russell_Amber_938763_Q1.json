          "conceptual_gap": "While the code does check if t!=0 before dividing, initializing n=0 suggests the student may not fully understand that: (1) the check itself is what prevents the exception, not the initialization, and (2) returning 0 as the acceleration when t=0 is mathematically undefined and semantically incorrect. The student appears to treat 0 as a 'safe fallback' rather than recognizing that t=0 represents an invalid input that should be rejected or handled explicitly.",
          "error_manifestation": "The code produces logically incorrect output when t=0 (returns 0 instead of rejecting the invalid input or prompting for re-entry). This represents flawed error handling rather than a runtime crash.",

          "conceptual_gap": "The student performs explicit conditional checks for division by zero (`if(t!=0)`) when using floating-point types (`double`). In Java, dividing a finite floating-point number by zero (e.g., `y/0.0`) results in `Infinity` or `NaN`, which is a defined floating-point value, not an exception that halts execution. While defensive programming is useful, the `if/else` structure here complicates a simple formula without preventing an unhandled runtime exception.",

          "conceptual_gap": "Java allows complex expressions to be evaluated and assigned in a single statement (e.g., `double n = (v1 - v0) / t;`).
