          "conceptual_gap": "While the code is not technically incorrect, it demonstrates a misunderstanding of assignment semantics. Direct assignment from input.nextDouble() directly into v0, v1, and t would be functionally identical. The student may believe that the intermediate step (temp_v0 -> v0) provides protection or validation, when in reality it simply adds unnecessary complexity without changing behavior. This suggests confusion about what assignment actually does and when it's necessary.",

          "conceptual_gap": "While hasNextDouble() checks are good practice, the combination with pre-initialization to 0.0 suggests the student doesn't fully understand that assignment overwrites previous values. The student may fear that if hasNextDouble() returns false, the variable would be corrupted, not recognizing that the variable retains its previous value (0.0) without being updated. This reflects uncertainty about the atomicity and definiteness of the assignment operation.",

This suggests a belief that interacting with the `Scanner` object requires maximum defensive scaffolding and that variables should not be assigned directly from I/O methods.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, a direct assignment like `v0 = input.nextDouble();` is standard and idiomatic, especially when the required checks (like `hasNextDouble()`) are handled outside the input block if necessary, or when assuming well-formed input as often done in simple CS1 assignments. The creation of temporary variables (`temp_v0`, `temp_v1`, `temp_t`) adds unnecessary complexity and verbosity without improving correctness or robustness in this specific context, indicating a confused or overly cautious approach to variable scope and assignment following I/O operations.",
