They read the inputs sequentially (which is correct), but assigned the $x_1$ value to a variable named `y` and the $y_1$ value to a variable named `n`, demonstrating a failure in mapping symbolic mathematical concepts to code variables.",

The student successfully tracked the custom assignment scheme in this simple case, but the fundamental flaw is treating symbolic names as expendable labels instead of aids for conceptual clarity, which often leads to complex logical errors when the code scales.",

In Java, variable names are arbitrary identifiers; the Scanner reads input sequentially into whatever variables the code specifies, regardless of their names. The prompt text 'Enter x1 and y1:' is just a human-readable message and has no effect on which variable receives which input value. The code reads the first number into y (line 5) and the second into n (line 6), when logically they should be x1 and y1.

The gap is that they failed to choose variable names that align with the conceptual entities being represented, which is standard practice for readability and preventing logic errors when subtraction order matters (e.g., $(x_2-x_1)$ vs $(y_2-y_1)$).
