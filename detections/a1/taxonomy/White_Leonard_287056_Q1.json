The condition 'if(n==v1-v0)' will always evaluate to true since n was just assigned the value v1-v0 on the previous line. This creates a redundant check that doesn't add any logical value.

The problem statement implicitly assumes valid input (t will not be zero in test cases), and the sample run doesn't show division-by-zero handling. This suggests the student is uncertain about when variables need initialization and whether preventive checks are necessary for a CS1 exercise. The actual gap is that the student added complexity that isn't required by the problem specification.",
