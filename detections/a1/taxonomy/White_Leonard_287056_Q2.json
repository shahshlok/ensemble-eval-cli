          "conceptual_gap": "The operational semantics of Java's Scanner input mean that if `hasNextDouble()` returns false (e.g., due to non-numeric text), the invalid token remains available in the input stream buffer. When the student skips consumption using an `if` statement, subsequent attempts to read (`hasNextDouble()`) will check the *same* unconsumed invalid token and fail repeatedly, causing the program to silently use default values (0) for all remaining variables instead of prompting for or reading new input.",

          "conceptual_gap": "The student is treating input reading as an inherently risky operation that must be conditionally guarded for every single variable assignment. While `hasNextDouble()` is useful for validation loops, using it only once per input followed by assignment means that if the user enters invalid input (something that prevents the program from progressing), the variable remains uninitialized (or zero, as initialized here), leading to incorrect calculation but preventing the actual reading function (`nextDouble()`) from being called, unless the input is valid. This structure is overly defensive and inefficient for sequential input tasks, where a simple `nextDouble()` would suffice if input is assumed correct, or a loop structure is necessary if malformed input must be handled robustly.",
          "error_manifestation": "Wrong output (0.0 cost) if the user enters non-numeric input for any prompt, as the conditional assignment will be skipped, leaving the variable at its default initialized value of 0.",
