The use of single-letter variables suggests they are viewed as temporary, interchangeable slots rather than meaningful identifiers.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, local variables should be declared close to their first use for scope management and readability.

This suggests the student does not fully trust or understand how methods effectively handle code reuse and return values for calculation.",
