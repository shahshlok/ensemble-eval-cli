          "conceptual_gap": "While it's true that Math.sqrt() of a negative number returns NaN, the student's check `if (z >= 0)` is unnecessary here because z is mathematically guaranteed to be non-negative (it's the sum of two squared values). More importantly, the student doesn't realize that if z were somehow negative, the conditional would silently set r to 0 instead of actually handling the error case. The real issue is that this check creates a logical flaw: if z < 0, the distance would be reported as 0, which is incorrect. The student seems to be applying a defensive pattern without understanding when it's actually needed.",
