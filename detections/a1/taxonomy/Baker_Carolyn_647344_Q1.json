More importantly, the student may not fully understand that if hasNextDouble() returns false, the program will proceed with default values (0.0), which will produce incorrect results. The student seems to think this defensive approach handles error cases, but it actually masks the problem and produces wrong output silently rather than informing the user of an input error.",

This suggests a possible misunderstanding that complex expressions need to be 'staged' through variables to execute properly.
