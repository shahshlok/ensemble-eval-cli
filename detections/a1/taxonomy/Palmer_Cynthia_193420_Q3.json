          "conceptual_gap": "The student has a flawed understanding of basic arithmetic. Squaring any real number always produces a non-negative result. Adding two non-negative numbers always produces a non-negative result. Therefore, `sumOfSquaresValue` can mathematically NEVER be negative in this context. The defensive check reveals the student doesn't fully grasp that (x2-x1)\u00b2 + (y2-y1)\u00b2 is always \u2265 0 by mathematical law, not by chance. This suggests confusion about the mathematical properties of the distance formula itself.",
