          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that when using `input.nextDouble()` sequentially to read coordinate pairs, the user will physically type 'x, then space/enter, then y', but that these inputs must be provided by the user immediately following the prompt on the console, often leading to combined input streams for multiple variables on one line.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student's implementation uses `input.nextDouble()` twice immediately following a single print statement for the coordinate pair. While this is logically correct in Java (waiting for the next available double token), the standard sample run formatting (e.g., `(x1, y1):00`) suggests the student intends to read both doubles sequentially from the same line, which `nextDouble()` handles correctly by consuming tokens. However, the student's prompt design (using `System.out.print` and then reading two values) often leads to confusion about when and how to enter multiple values on a single physical line if the user decides to include spaces or enters. The sample run shows the user entering `00` for `x1` and `y1`, which is highly unusual input formatting if the user intended 0 and 0. If the user typed `0 0`, the input structure would be fine, but the *prompting style* encourages dense, potentially hard-to-parse input if delimiters are expected.",
          "error_manifestation": "Wrong output if the user doesn't understand token separation (spaces or newlines) when providing sequentialnextDouble() inputs, as suggested by the sample run's highly compressed input format (e.g., `00` instead of `0 0`).",
