          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, Scanner.nextDouble() reads values sequentially from input in the order they are called, regardless of variable names. The prompt text is purely for human readability and has no effect on which variable receives which input. The code reads two values into x1 and y1 correctly in sequence, but this appears to work only by coincidence of reading order, not because the Scanner understands the prompt.",
          "error_manifestation": "The code happens to work for the given sample input, but the student's mental model is fundamentally flawed. If the input format changed (e.g., all values on one line), or if they misunderstood the order, they would be confused about why their 'named variables' didn't receive the 'right' values.",

          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that when multiple inputs are needed sequentially (like x and y coordinates), they can be read using `nextDouble()` without concern for how the user formats the input (e.g., separating inputs with spaces or newlines), and that the input mechanism will automatically associate the first available number with the first variable and the second available number with the second variable, regardless of contiguous input.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student's model of the `Scanner` is correct in that it tokenizes input by whitespace. However, the student's prompt design and the provided sample input ('00', '50', '05') suggest an assumption about contiguous, non-separated input that would be parsed correctly. When the user enters '00' for (x1, y1) and hits enter, `nextDouble()` reads the first '0' into `x1` (treating '00' as two tokens if space-separated, or just '0' if the prompt implies contiguous reading of single characters which is incorrect for `nextDouble`). More likely, the student is expecting the user to input two numbers separated by a space/newline, but is *testing* with contiguous zero input `00` which works because `nextDouble()` handles two numbers sequentially. The true gap is the prompt misleading the user, potentially causing issues if input isn't space-separated. In this specific code, the `nextDouble()` calls themselves are technically correct based on standard Java I/O behavior (reading tokens), but the structure (reading two tokens per print statement) leads to unusual I/O handling that often reflects a weak mental model of token consumption.",
          "error_manifestation": "Requires non-standard input formatting (e.g., using spaces or newlines to separate coordinates) despite the prompt suggesting contiguous entry like `00` or `5 0` for two variables, or relying on System.in's buffering to feed two simultaneous tokens.",
