The student adds unnecessary conditional checks (if (sum >= 0.0)) that suggest they believe Math.sqrt() might not handle edge cases properly, when in fact the function is robust. This reflects uncertainty about what library functions guarantee.",

          "conceptual_gap": "While mathematically valid (negative values under a square root are problematic), the check is overly conservative. More importantly, the student seems to believe that Math.sqrt() will fail or throw an exception if given a negative number, when in fact it will return NaN. The real issue is not that the check is wrong, but that it suggests the student doesn't understand that Heron's formula's product should mathematically always be non-negative for valid triangles, and the check itself is defensive programming masking incomplete understanding of when degenerate triangles occur.",
