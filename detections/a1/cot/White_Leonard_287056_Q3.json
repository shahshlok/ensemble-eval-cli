They think that if the required input is not available or is incorrectly formatted, the program will harmlessly skip the assignment, allowing the variable to default to its initial value (0.0) and continue execution.",
          "conceptual_gap": "For sequential, mandatory inputs, this pattern is highly fragile. If a user provides invalid input (e.g., text instead of a number), or if they simply provide fewer tokens than expected, `hasNextDouble()` fails, the coordinate variable retains `0.0` (its default), and the offending token is *not* consumed. This leaves the bad token in the stream, often causing subsequent mandatory inputs (L13, L14 for x2 and y2) to also immediately fail their `hasNextDouble()` checks, potentially causing the entire calculation to use `(0, 0)` for the coordinates that failed to read, without generating an exception or explicitly notifying the user of the input mismatch.",
