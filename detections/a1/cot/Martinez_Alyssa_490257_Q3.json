          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, the product of any `double` with itself (`x * x`) is guaranteed to be non-negative (either positive, 0.0, or positive infinity/NaN). The sum of two non-negative doubles will also be non-negative. Standard floating-point precision, while susceptible to small errors, does not suddenly flip a mathematically positive quantity (the sum of squares) into a negative value, especially not in a simple calculation like this. The check implies a fundamental distrust in the arithmetic machine's ability to preserve the non-negativity property of squares.",
