          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that Java input parsing requires manual character extraction checks to handle specific sample input formats like '00'. They assume that if the input string contains exactly two characters and no space, the first character necessarily represents the x-coordinate and the second character represents the y-coordinate, and these values can be reliably extracted using `Character.getNumericValue()`, regardless of the numeric magnitude of the coordinates.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student fails to utilize standard, robust methods for parsing coordinates (such as using `Scanner.nextDouble()` iteratively, or consistently splitting by space and parsing). Instead, they implemented a highly fragile, custom parser based on string length (L15) and manual character manipulation (L16-L17). This mechanism correctly handles only single-digit coordinates (0-9) concatenated without spaces. This approach breaks down completely if coordinates require two or more digits. If coordinates are multi-digit and entered without a space (e.g., input '105'), the `if` condition fails, and their subsequent `else` block (L20-L22) attempts to split the non-spaced string by whitespace, resulting in only one token and causing an `java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` when attempting to access the second coordinate.",
          "error_manifestation": "Functionally correct for single-digit coordinates matching the sample run, but leads to an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` for multi-digit coordinate inputs lacking explicit space delimiters (e.g., inputting x=10, y=5 as '105').",

          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that when a two-digit coordinate pair (like '50' or '05') is read as a combined string, calling `Character.getNumericValue(char)` will convert the character representation of a digit into its corresponding numerical value (e.g., '5' becomes 5.0, '0' becomes 0.0), even if the coordinate is greater than 9.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student correctly uses `Character.getNumericValue(char)` when the coordinate value is 0 (mapping '0' to 0). However, they fail dramatically when a coordinate is 5. When the user inputs '50' for (x2, y2), the student code attempts to parse character '5' and character '0'. `Character.getNumericValue()` correctly returns the integer value 5 and 0, which are then stored as doubles. The conceptual gap is not in the mechanics of `Character.getNumericValue` itself, but in believing this method is a resilient way to parse numerical user input, especially for numbers larger than single digits (which the prompt implies based on the sample run values, although the sample run only uses 0 and 5). The primary error is treating user input as potentially single characters when it should be treated as complete numerical tokens (strings) that need careful string splitting and `Double.parseDouble` when coordinates are combined without spaces.",
          "error_manifestation": "Incorrect computed coordinates, leading to incorrect side lengths, and consequently, incorrect triangle area calculation. The coordinates used in calculation (P2: (5.0, 0.0), P3: (0.0, 5.0)) match the expected sample run coordinates, but the logic implementing this relies on the input being interpreted digit-by-digit, which is flawed for general numerical input.",
