          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that when a `System.out.print` statement asks for two values, and the `Scanner` is primed to read two separate `double` values consecutively (e.g., `input.nextDouble(); double y1 = input.nextDouble();`), the user will inherently provide these two inputs concatenated as a single string token without a delimiter, and the `Scanner` will automatically parse components of that single token into the requested numeric types.",
          "conceptual_gap": "Java's `Scanner.nextDouble()` tokenizes input based on delimiters (usually whitespace, including spaces and newlines). To successfully read two distinct doubles, the user must provide two distinct tokens, separated by a delimiter, even if they appear on the same line. If the user types '00' when prompted for two numbers, the first `nextDouble()` attempts to consume '00' (reading 0.0), and the second `nextDouble()` is then blocked, waiting for the subsequent token (which is why the trace shows the program waiting for more input or potentially failing if the input stream closes immediately).",
          "error_manifestation": "Runtime flow control error where the program pauses indefinitely or fails to match the expected number of tokens from the provided single-token input (e.g., '00').",
