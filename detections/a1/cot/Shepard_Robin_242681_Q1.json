          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that it is always necessary or beneficial to create temporary, redundant variables (like `startingVelocityValue` or `timeValue`) to hold the values already stored in the input variables (like `startingVelocityInput` or `timeInput`) before using them in calculation or conditional logic. This suggests a belief that the primary input variables should remain untouched or that intermediate variables are required for standard computational steps.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java (and most imperative languages), variable declaration assigns a label to a memory location holding a value. Once a variable (`startingVelocityInput`) holds a value, using a second variable (`startingVelocityValue`) to hold the exact same value is unnecessary overhead. The system uses the value regardless of which label references it. The student's model introduces unnecessary complexity and lines of code without providing any functional benefit for immutable values once read.",

          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that all variables must be initialized to a 'safe' default value (like 0.0 for `averageAccelerationResult`) even when they are immediately assigned a calculated value within a guaranteed execution path (like the `if (timeValue != 0.0)` block, which covers the typical case). This suggests a misunderstanding of variable scope and definite assignment rules, confusing necessary initialization (to prevent compiler errors when usage precedes definite assignment) with generalized best practice.",
          "conceptual_gap": "While initializing variables can prevent compiler errors, in cases where a variable is guaranteed to be assigned a value before use (such as within an `if-else` block covering all possibilities, or before the conditional structure if the default value is required outside), initializing it to a 'default' value (line 26) is redundant if a meaningful assignment occurs immediately afterward (lines 35 or 38). Had the student omitted the `else` block, the initialization would have been necessary for the variable to be used safely outside the `if` block, but given the complete conditional structure, initializing to 0.0 is functionally a throwaway assignment.",
