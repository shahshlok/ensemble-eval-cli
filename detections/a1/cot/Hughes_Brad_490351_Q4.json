          "conceptual_gap": "The student confuses the mechanism of the `Scanner` class with the visual layout of the prompt. `s.nextDouble()` reads the *next available* numerical token. A single `System.out.print` prompt is followed by two separate `s.nextDouble()` calls, meaning the program expects two distinct input tokens (like '0' [space] '0' or '0' [newline] '0') for x1 and y1, but the prompt only shows once. The student failed to design the input reading loop or structure to explicitly handle the sequential reading of multiple variables per prompt.",

The calculation of side lengths using $a^2 + b^2$ is correctly implemented as `a*a + b*b`.
