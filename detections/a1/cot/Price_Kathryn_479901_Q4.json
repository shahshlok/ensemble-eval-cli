          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that when using `Scanner.nextDouble()` sequentially after a single `System.out.print` prompt intended for two values (like '(x1, y1):'), the user is expected to input both numbers on the same line, separated by a space, comma, or just concatenated (e.g., '00'). The student expects the input buffer processing to map the first token to the first variable (`x1`) and the second token to the second variable (`y1`), even if the prompt implies a concatenated input format.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student confuses the visual prompt representation (e.g., needing 0,0) with Java's input parsing semantics. `Scanner.nextDouble()` reads until it finds the *next* valid double token, ignoring intervening whitespace. If the user accidentally concatenated the inputs (like '00', '50', '05' as shown in the Sample Run), the student's code relies entirely on the input mechanism correctly splitting these concatenated numbers into separate valid double tokens (e.g., '00' becoming '0' and '0'). While this specific concatenated input '00' works because '0' is a valid double, the input mechanism behavior is not robust to general concatenated inputs (like '1234' would be read as one number, not '12' and '34'). The flaw is the misleading prompt/variable reading structure which doesn't explicitly account for user input style, leading to potential reading errors if the user follows the concatenated sample run format strictly.",
          "error_manifestation": "Potential runtime misassignment of numerical values if the user enters concatenated input that does not consist of '0' followed by '0', or if the user enters a single sequence of digits intended as two separate numbers (e.g., if the user enters '1.5 2.5', it works; but if they enter '1.52.5', it reads '1.5' then throws an error or misreads '2.5' as the next variable's input depending on formatting). In the provided sample run ('00', '50', '05'), the code successfully parses the *first* digit of each pair as a distinct token (x1=0, y1=0, x2=5, y2=0, x3=0, y3=5) because the student's code expects two separate calls to `nextDouble()` per prompt, but the sample run output implies a concatenated entry on a single line.",
