          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that to execute a mathematical formula involving multiple steps (subtraction followed by division), the computation must be broken down into assignments to distinct variables (`a`, `b`) before the final step (`c = a/b`). This suggests the student doubts Java's ability to correctly evaluate the full expression, `(v1 - v0) / t`, in a single line.",
          "conceptual_gap": "Java handles compound expressions very efficiently using operator precedence rules and can execute `c = (v1 - v0) / t;` directly. The student's mental model requires redundant intermediate storage, forcing a sequential, procedural simulation of the calculation rather than leveraging the language's capabilities for expression evaluation.",
