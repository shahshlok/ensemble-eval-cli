          "conceptual_gap": "Java's `Scanner` tokenizes input based on default whitespace delimiters (space, tab, or newline). If a user inputs '00' as a single entry, the entire '00' is consumed as a single token representing the value 0.0 by the first call to `nextDouble()`. The second consecutive call will then block, waiting for additional input, because no second token was provided.",

          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that printing a prompt and then calling `x.nextDouble()` multiple times will require the user to input data corresponding exactly to the number of prompts displayed. Specifically, they expect the input `(x1, y1):` to consume only `x1` and then wait for an input character for `y1` after the subsequent `x.nextDouble()` call, isolated by the subsequent prompt.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The `Scanner` object's `nextDouble()` method reads until it finds a token that represents a double, consuming the input token and any surrounding whitespace (including newlines and spaces) as delimiters. When the user enters '00' on the first prompt, the student consumes the first `0` for `x1` and the second `0` for `y1`, all from the initial input line. The subsequent `System.out.print` statements for `(x2, y2)` and `(x3, y3)` are printed *before* the input for those coordinates is actually processed, but the user is expected to type the next numbers regardless of the stream's current position.",
          "error_manifestation": "Incorrect interpretation of input (e.g., if the user intended to input 0 and 0, but typed '00', the program correctly reads 0.0 and 0.0 only because the inputs are separated by delimiters which are implicit in the tracing logic, or if the user used the sample run input '00', it would be parsed as 0.0 and 0.0. A more subtle error occurs if the user types '0 0' and presses Enter, two values are read immediately even if the programmer intended for only one value to be read per prompt line.) However, the key misconception here is about input sequencing related to output prompts.",
