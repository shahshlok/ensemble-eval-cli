          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that variables holding important input values (like `distance`, `mpg_value`, `pricePerGallon`) must be copied into separate 'safe' variables (`safe_distance`, `safe_mpg`, `safe_price`) before being used in calculations or complex conditional logic. This suggests a fear that the original variables would be accidentally mutated or corrupted by the subsequent arithmetic operation or control flow.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, primitive types (like `double`) store values directly. When used in expressions or assigned to a new variable, their value is copied, and the original variable remains unchanged. Creating redundant variables like `safe_distance`, `safe_mpg`, `safe_price`, and `final_cost` provides no functional benefit or safety, as the original input variables are already localized to the `main` method and would not be modified by their use in the calculation or the `if` statement.",
