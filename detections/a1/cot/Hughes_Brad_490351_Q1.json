          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that complex mathematical formulas must be broken down into discrete, named, single-operation steps, requiring an assignment statement for the numerator (a), a potentially redundant assignment for the denominator (b=t), and a final assignment for the quotient (c). This suggests a reliance on sequential, single-step operations mirroring a basic calculator or assembly-like register model, rather than leveraging Java's capacity to evaluate compound expressions.",
          "conceptual_gap": "Java execution allows the reuse of existing variables directly in complex expressions and adheres to operator precedence (e.g., `c = (v1 - v0) / t;`). The student's mental model unnecessarily stages the calculation through intermediate variables (`a`, `b`, `c`), most clearly evidenced by copying the value of `t` into `b` before division, indicating a failure to trust or utilize the existing variable definition for the calculation.",
