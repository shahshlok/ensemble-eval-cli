They are mentally mapping the fraction from algebra onto the code without considering Java's precedence rules.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, as in most programming languages, the division operator `/` has higher precedence than addition `+`. This means that in the expression `sideOneLength + sideTwoLength + sideThreeLength / 2.0`, Java evaluates `sideThreeLength / 2.0` first, then adds `sideOneLength` and `sideTwoLength` to that result. The correct translation of the mathematical formula s = (side1 + side2 + side3) / 2 must use parentheses: `(sideOneLength + sideTwoLength + sideThreeLength) / 2.0`. The student's comment \"I follow the formula straight\" shows a mental model where the code behaves like the visually written fraction, with an implicit numerator and denominator, rather than an expression governed by fixed operator precedence rules. This gap leads to a semi-perimeter much larger than intended, which then propagates into Heron's formula and produces a wildly incorrect area.",
