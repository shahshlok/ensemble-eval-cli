          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that printing a prompt and then immediately asking for input via `nextDouble()` will result in the input appearing directly after the prompt, regardless of whether the prompt used `print` or `println`, and that only the required data values will be consumed from the input stream.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student failed to account for how the `System.in` scanner interacts with the terminal prompts. Specifically, when using `System.out.print` for a prompt like `(x1, y1):`, if the subsequent input reading processes two numbers, the typical workflow involves the program waiting after the prompt, the user typing multiple numbers (e.g., `0 0`), and then pressing Enter. The student's code structure correctly reads two numbers per prompt, but the prompts themselves are intended to visually group the input, which is handled correctly here. However, based on the *Sample run* format provided in the prompt (`(x1, y1):00`), the student's code is correctly interpreting the need to read multiple values for a single prompt line, which is not a misconception, but rather a successful implementation of sequential input reading within a single print statement context.",
          "error_manifestation": "None. The code correctly reads two doubles immediately after the print statement, which matches the behavior derived from the sample run's output structure, assuming the input stream provided two numbers sequentially (e.g., '0' then '0').",

They may perceive this procedural decomposition as mandatory for readability or execution, or they may lack confidence in combining steps into fewer, more complex expressions (e.g., `double side1 = Math.sqrt(Math.pow(x2 - x1, 2) + Math.pow(y2 - y1, 2));`).",
          "conceptual_gap": "While using many variables does not cause an error, it reflects a less mature understanding of how complex mathematical expressions can be evaluated and assigned directly in Java statements.
