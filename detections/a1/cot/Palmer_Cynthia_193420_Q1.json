          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that when a variable represents critical input that will undergo a safety verification (like checking for a zero denominator), it is necessary to create a dedicated, newly named copy of that variable (`safeTimeIntervalT`) for use in the condition check and subsequent calculation. They seem wary of using the original input variable (`timeIntervalT`) directly for these operations.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, assigning one primitive variable to another (`double safeTimeIntervalT = timeIntervalT;`) creates a complete, independent copy of the value. There is no functional or safety benefit in introducing `safeTimeIntervalT`. The student could have performed the division check (`if (timeIntervalT == 0.0)`) and used `timeIntervalT` in the resulting division calculation (L35) directly. The redundancy suggests a mental model where variables used for input must be segregated from variables used for integrity checks or calculation steps, even when they are functionally identical.",
