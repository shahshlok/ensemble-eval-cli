          "inferred_category_name": "Input Parsing Expectation",
          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that when multiple calls to `Scanner.nextDouble()` are made sequentially, the user will automatically be prompted and allowed to enter both values on separate lines, or that the input system is resilient enough to handle multiple space-separated inputs following the single output prompt (e.g., '(x1, y1):'). The student expects the input sequence '00<newline>50<newline>05' (as implied by the sample run format, though the code separates input actions and prompts) to be parsed such that '0' is x1 and '0' is y1 (for the first pair), '5' is x2 and '0' is y2 (for the second pair), and '0' is x3 and '5' is y3 (for the third pair).",
          "conceptual_gap": "The Java `Scanner.nextDouble()` method reads the next token compatible with a double type from the input stream. When the prompt `'(x1, y1):'` is printed, the student code immediately calls `userInputScanner.nextDouble()` twice in a row (lines 13 and 14). If the user types `00` (which is technically one token '0' followed by one token '0', or possibly the string '00' representing the number 0.0 or 0.0), the scanner will consume the first value for x1 and immediately attempt to consume the next token for y1 without waiting for another distinct prompt or newline if the tokens are already available on the input buffer. The sample run input `00` suggests an ambiguity in how the user input is being simulated, but standard practice requires two numbers for two `nextDouble()` calls. If the user intends to input 0 and 0, they usually type '0 0'. If they type '00', depending on the environment, this might be read as a single token '00' (i.e., the number 0.0 or 0.0) resulting in an `InputMismatchException` or incorrect variable assignment when the second `nextDouble()` waits for a non-existent token.",
          "error_manifestation": "Hidden ambiguity or incorrect input assignment. Assuming the sample run meant: P1: 0 0, P2: 5 0, P3: 0 5, the code structure forces the user to provide two numbers immediately after a single prompt for each point.",
