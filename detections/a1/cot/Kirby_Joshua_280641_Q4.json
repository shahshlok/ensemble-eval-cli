          "conceptual_gap": "The student implements unnecessary defensive checks (`if (product > 0.0)`) in the main calculation and (`if (sum >= 0.0)`) in the helper function. In the context of calculating side lengths (where `sum` is `xDiff^2 + yDiff^2`, it is guaranteed to be non-negative) and Heron's formula for a valid triangle (where the intermediate product `s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)` should be non-negative, otherwise it's either a degenerate case handled correctly by `area = 0.0` or an impossible triangle, which would also result in a small negative number due to floating point arithmetic), these checks are redundant. The square root function will handle zero correctly, and while floating point errors might occasionally lead to small negative products, a professional implementation relies on the mathematical guarantee or uses a robust method like `Math.max(0, product)` before taking the square root, rather than a strict `> 0.0` check. For the distance function, `xDiffSquared + yDiffSquared` is always mathematically non-negative, rendering the check completely useless.",
