Using the descriptive variable names (`distance_miles`, `mpg`, `price_per_gallon`) directly in the calculation is the standard and most readable practice. The creation of `a`, `b`, and `c` is redundant and suggests a misunderstanding of variable stability, persistence, or the necessity of simple variable names for mathematical computation in code.",
