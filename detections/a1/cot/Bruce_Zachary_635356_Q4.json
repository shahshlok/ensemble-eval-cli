Although the `Scanner.nextDouble()` calls correctly execute sequentially (lines 7 & 8, 10 & 11, 13 & 14), the student failed to model the need for explicit prompts for the second coordinates (`y1`, `y2`, `y3`), leading to a confusing user experience where the program pauses silently to read input.",

          "conceptual_gap": "The student confuses the visual presentation of the prompt (suggesting concatenated input like '00') with how the `Scanner` object processes input tokens. In Java, `x.nextDouble()` reads the next complete, delimited token (number) from the input stream. If the user types '00' and presses enter, '00' is read as a single token (0.0). The second call to `x.nextDouble()` (for y1) then waits for the next token, which is not provided on the same line, resulting in the scanner consuming the entire '00' as the value for x1, and then waiting for an additional input for y1.",
          "error_manifestation": "The program fails to match the sample run's input structure because it expects three separate inputs (0 0, 5 0, 0 5) but consumes the first two digits ('00') as a single token (0.0) for x1, then waits for a second token for y1, repeating this behavior for all points. If the student follows the sample run literally by typing '00', '50', and '05', the resulting computed coordinates are incorrect relative to the mathematical expectation.",
