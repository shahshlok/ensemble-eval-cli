This is a common error stemming from the implicit assumption that raw `double` output is acceptable, ignoring the specialized formatting needed for user-facing currency values. While the calculation is mathematically sound, the lack of formatting techniques (like `String.format`, `printf`, or `DecimalFormat`) demonstrates an incomplete understanding of standard requirements for handling floating-point numbers in output.",
