Because they know `Math.sqrt()` requires a non-negative input, they feel the need to include an explicit conditional check (if >= 0.0) to guard against this mathematically impossible scenario.",

Consequently, the sum of two non-negative results is guaranteed to be non-negative. This defensive check is mathematically and practically redundant, revealing a reluctance to rely on the fundamental stability and properties of Java's numerical arithmetic.",
