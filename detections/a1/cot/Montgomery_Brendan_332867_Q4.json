          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that variables should be named using consecutive single letters of the alphabet (`a`, `b`, `c`, ... `q`) to sequentially store input and intermediate results, rather than choosing descriptive names that reflect the variable's role (e.g., `x1`, `y1`, `side1`, `dx`, `area`). This suggests a viewing of variables as generic, ordered storage slots rather than semantically meaningful symbols.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In programming, symbolic names (variables) are intended to provide context and map directly to domain concepts (like an x-coordinate or side length), which greatly aids in program clarity, debugging, and maintenance. The student's method of using a long list of single, sequential letters ignores the readability imperative of symbolic naming.",
          "error_manifestation": "Functionally correct code, but extremely poor readability and maintainability due to variable declaration and usage.",

          "conceptual_gap": "Java's `Scanner.nextDouble()` reads the next token (a double). When multiple input statements are chained on a single line (like in line 5), or when the user provides multiple tokens separated by whitespace in response to a single prompt, the first few calls to `nextDouble()` will greedily consume these tokens immediately without waiting for intervening prompts. This results in unintended variable assignment and skips the input corresponding to later prompts.",
          "error_manifestation": "Wrong output/Logical error in variable assignment. The inputs meant for (x2, y2) and (x3, y3) are consumed prematurely, or the program consumes inputs from the same line that were meant for separate prompt stages.",
