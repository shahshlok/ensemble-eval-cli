They likely learned the rule 'close your scanners/streams' but missed the exception regarding System.in.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, closing a `Scanner` object also closes the underlying `InputStream` it is wrapping. When the `Scanner` is attached to `System.in`, closing it effectively closes the standard input stream for the entire application (JVM lifetime). While closing I/O resources is good practice, closing `System.in` can lead to problems if subsequent parts of the program or other classes need to read input, as `System.in` cannot be reopened.",
