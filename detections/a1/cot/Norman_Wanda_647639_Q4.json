          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that displaying a prompt for coordinates, such as \"(x1, y1):\", ensures that only one input token is read from the user after that prompt, and that the second coordinate (`y1`) must be entered after the next sequential prompt is displayed. Alternatively, the student believes that the standard input stream will wait for new user input associated strictly with the latest `System.out.print` prompt.",
          "conceptual_gap": "Java's `Scanner.nextDouble()` simply consumes the next available token in the input stream, regardless of how many tokens were provided on the previous line or what prompt was last displayed. The code executes `input.nextDouble()` twice (L10 and L11) immediately after displaying a single prompt (L9). If the user provides only one token (e.g., '00') in response to the first prompt, the second read (L11) will immediately consume the first token provided for the *next* coordinate ('50' from the sample run), leading to an early exhausting of the required 6 input tokens and a subsequent runtime error.",
          "error_manifestation": "Runtime exception (java.util.NoSuchElementException) because the program attempts to read a sixth coordinate (y3 or y2, depending on tokenization) when only three tokens were provided according to the sample run trace.",
