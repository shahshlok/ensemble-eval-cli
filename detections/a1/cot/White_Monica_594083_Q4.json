          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that when reading two variables sequentially (x1, then y1) using `nextDouble()` on a single line of input, the Java Scanner object will implicitly handle the separation of coordinates if the user types them immediately adjacent to each other (e.g., '00' for x1=0, y1=0). The student expects the first `nextDouble()` call to read '0' and the second to read the subsequent '0', or perhaps that the input prompt structure somehow requires the user to input the coordinates immediately followed by each other without a separator.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The Java `Scanner.nextDouble()` method reads the next complete token representing a double value, delimited by whitespace (space, tab, newline). If the user types '00', the Scanner treats this as a single token: the double value 0.0. The first call to `input.nextDouble()` consumes '00' (setting x1 = 0.0). The second call, intended for y1, blocks waiting for new input or, depending on the exact execution environment/buffer state, it might immediately consume the next user input intended for the *next* coordinate pair.",
          "error_manifestation": "Input reading is desynchronized. If the user input follows the sample run literally ('00', '50', '05' without spaces/newlines), the first token is consumed by x1 (x1=0.0) but y1 remains unread, leading to a synchronization error where the expected inputs for (x1, y1), (x2, y2), etc., are not assigned correctly. In a common console environment where '00' is entered and followed by hitting ENTER, x1 consumes '0.0', and y1 consumes the EOF or subsequent text buffer entry, leading to unpredictable/incorrect assignments for the subsequent variables.",

          "conceptual_gap": "While the code structure `double x1 = input.nextDouble(); double y1 = input.nextDouble();` expects two tokens, the sample input `00` provided in the problem description is unconventional. If the user executes the sample input literally by typing `00` and pressing Enter, x1 reads 0.0, and y1 waits for the next token, resulting in incorrect variable assignment. The student did not implement explicit parsing logic (like character manipulation) to split '00' into '0' and '0' and relies solely on `nextDouble()` which requires whitespace separation for multiple tokens.",
