          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that 'using' the program from Question 3 means implementing the exact logic (the distance formula) established in that previous context. They do not understand that the instruction implies defining a reusable method for distance calculation and invoking it multiple times in Q4, leading them to copy and paste the calculation steps inline instead.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student lacks a fundamental understanding of modular programming principles, specifically method abstraction and invocation. To reuse code effectively in Java, duplicated logic (like the distance formula) should be encapsulated in a function/method (e.g., `calculateDistance(x1, y1, x2, y2)`) and called as needed. Implementing the calculation steps repeatedly violates this principle and the implicit architectural requirement of the prompt.",

They think reusing single letters (a, b, c, d) across different computational contexts is acceptable as long as the computation is correct.",

The student fails to recognize that using 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd' for Heron's formula factors, after already using 'a1', 'a2', 'a3', 'b1', 'b2', 'b3' for coordinate differences, creates semantic confusion and makes the code harder to verify and maintain. Good variable naming helps prevent bugs and demonstrates understanding of the underlying mathematics.",
