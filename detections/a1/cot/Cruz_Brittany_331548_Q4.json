          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that when reading multiple integers (`nextInt()`) following a single generic prompt like `(x1, y1):`, the Java Scanner will inherently know to separate adjacent digits entered by the user (e.g., typing '00' for point (0, 0)) into individual tokens corresponding to the sequential variable assignments.",
          "conceptual_gap": "Java's `Scanner.nextInt()` tokenizes input based on known delimiters (defaulting to whitespace). If a user enters `00` as a single token, `nextInt()` reads '00' as a single integer (0 or 00). The subsequent `nextInt()` call (for the y-coordinate) will then block and wait for a second token, as the first token was entirely consumed by the first `nextInt()` call. This leads to user confusion or runtime blocking because the user must explicitly separate the coordinates using whitespace or a newline, despite the compressed format suggested by the student's output prompt and the sample run.",
          "error_manifestation": "Runtime blocking, requiring the user to unexpectedly provide a second input token for a single coordinate pair prompt, contradicting the aesthetic design implied by the sample run.",
