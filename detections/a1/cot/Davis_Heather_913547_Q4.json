By declaring and using a massive sequence of single-letter variables (a, b, c... w) for every coordinate, intermediate calculation step, and final result, the student attempts to simplify the programming process, assuming the computer tracks the sequence correctly regardless of semantic meaning.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The purpose of descriptive variable naming in Java (and most modern languages) is to map human conceptual models (like 'x1 coordinate' or 'side length') onto the execution state for readability, debugging, and maintenance. The student's model treats variables as ephemeral sequence markers rather than semantic containers, indicating ignorance regarding programming best practices enforced by human cognitive needs, even if the JVM successfully executes the sequential steps.",

If the user inputs '0 0' and the code executes `double a=x.nextDouble(), b=x.nextDouble();`, the first call reads '0' into `a`, and the second call reads the subsequent '0' into `b`. The student failed to match the number of input requests with the number of required `nextDouble()` calls for subsequent points, specifically assuming that a single `nextDouble()` call could handle both x and y coordinates for P2 and P3.",
