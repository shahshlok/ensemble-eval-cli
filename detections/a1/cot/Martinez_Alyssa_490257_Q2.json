They also believe that later uses of these variables (e.g., in the if condition and arithmetic) will transparently use whatever the user typed during those nextDouble() calls.",

The program only changes a variable's value when an assignment statement (e.g., drivingDistanceInMiles = userInputScanner.nextDouble();) explicitly stores the returned value into that variable. In this code, drivingDistanceInMiles, milesPerGallonValue, and pricePerGallonInDollars are all initialized to 0.0 and never updated, because the return values of nextDouble() are ignored. As a result, milesPerGallonValue remains 0.0, the condition if (milesPerGallonValue != 0.0) is false, and the calculation block is skipped. The tripCostInDollars variable therefore stays at its default 0.0, causing the output to always be 'The cost of driving is $0.0' regardless of the inputs.
