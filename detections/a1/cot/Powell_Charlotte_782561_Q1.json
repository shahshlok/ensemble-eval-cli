          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that when reading multiple required inputs sequentially from a Scanner, each read operation (`input.nextDouble()`) must be individually guarded by a check (`input.hasNextDouble()`) to prevent runtime exceptions if the corresponding input token is missing. If the check fails, the variable should retain its initialized default value (0.0) rather than pausing execution or signaling an error, allowing the program to calculate a result using zero for the missing input.",
          "conceptual_gap": "For required sequential inputs read from `System.in`, standard practice is to call `nextDouble()` directly. If input is missing, Java will typically block or throw an exception, signaling an operational failure, which is appropriate when required data is absent. By using conditional assignment and initialization to 0.0, the student silences the failure of input acquisition, leading to the use of an incorrect default value (0.0) in the final calculation, contradicting the requirement to read values from the user.",

          "conceptual_gap": "The student uses excessive and redundant control flow (`if (input.hasNextDouble())`) inside a block where synchronous console input is expected after a prompt. While `hasNextDouble()` is correct for robust error-checking against non-numeric input, its use here, combined with initializing the variables to 0.0 only to immediately check and overwrite them, suggests a concern about variable scope or defensive programming that is overapplied. Crucially, the student initializes `v0`, `v1`, and `t` to 0.0 (lines 10-12) and then uses compound statements (lines 14-25) that only update these variables if `hasNextDouble()` returns true. If the user provides all three numbers as requested, these assignments are redundant but harmless. However, if the user terminates input early (e.g., provides only one number), the remaining variables stay at their initialized value of 0.0, which then leads to incorrect calculation or potential division by zero, showing the conditional input block is not robust for guaranteeing all required inputs were received.",

Variables are initialized to 0.0 (line 27), two `if` statements check for division by zero (`if (t != 0.0)` and `if (denominator != 0.0)`), and two intermediate variables (`numerator`, `denominator`) are created although they only exist to hold simple temporary values. The check `if (denominator != 0.0)` on line 34 is completely redundant because `denominator` is assigned to `t` on line 32, and `t` was already verified to be non-zero on line 29.
