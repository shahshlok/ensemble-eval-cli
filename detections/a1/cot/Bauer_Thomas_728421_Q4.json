          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that printing a prompt like '(x1, y1):' and immediately following it with two `userInputScanner.nextDouble()` calls guarantees that the user will provide two corresponding inputs, and that the single line entry implied by the sample run (e.g., '00') will somehow be parsed as two distinct coordinates (0.0 and 0.0). Alternatively, they assume that the program pauses exactly after each `nextDouble()` call regardless of how many tokens are currently available in the input buffer.",
          "conceptual_gap": "Java's `Scanner.nextDouble()` consumes the next complete whitespace-delimited numerical token available in the input buffer, regardless of how many tokens were entered by the user in response to the most recent prompt. If the user types `00` followed by Enter, this results in a single token (`0.0`). Given the input stream `00\n50\n05\n`: L13 consumes 0.0 (x1=0.0), L14 consumes 50.0 (y1=50.0). L18 consumes 5.0 (x2=5.0). L19 (y2) then stalls, waiting for further input. This causes variable assignments to become completely asynchronous with the printed prompts, resulting in incorrect coordinate values and a program hang.",
          "error_manifestation": "Input synchronization error, leading to variables being incorrectly assigned values intended for subsequent coordinates (e.g., P1 becoming (0.0, 50.0) instead of (0.0, 0.0) and P2 becoming partially defined), causing the program to stall (hang) waiting for input at line 19.",

          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that printing a single input prompt like '(x1, y1):' followed by two distinct calls to `nextDouble()` will prompt the user for the X coordinate, receive the X input, and then pause again to prompt/wait for the Y coordinate input, effectively treating the input sequence as a series of separate, user-driven prompts for each coordinate.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The `Scanner.nextDouble()` method simply consumes the next available token (a double value) from the input stream, regardless of whether a new prompt was issued. When a user enters multiple numbers on one line (e.g., '0 0') or concatenates them (e.g., '00' interpreted as `0.0`), the sequential calls to `nextDouble()` will consume these values immediately. In the sample run, the input '00' is read as a single token `0.0` for `pointOneXCoordinate`. Since the second coordinate `pointOneYCoordinate` is expected immediately after (Line 14), and no token follows `00`, the program waits indefinitely or throws an exception depending on the environment, or fails to parse the subsequent line correctly if the intended input was multi-line or whitespace separated. Crucially, the student failed to handle two inputs per prompt correctly, assuming the output prompt would synchronize step-by-step with *each* input read.",
          "error_manifestation": "Incorrect variable assignment or program stall/crash due to improperly managed input buffer relative to sequential reads. Given the provided sample run structure ('(x1, y1):00'), if the user enters '00' followed immediately by '50' on a subsequent line without delimiter/space, the parsing sequence breaks down.",
