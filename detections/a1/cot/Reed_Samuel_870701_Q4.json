          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that calling `input.nextDouble()` twice on a single input line, especially when inputting two values without a space delimiter (like '00', '50', '05'), will correctly parse the first digit/value as the first double and the second digit/value as the second double, similar to how integer input might sometimes behave or failing to recognize the specific behavior of `nextDouble()`.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, standard `Scanner` input methods like `nextDouble()` read tokens delimited by whitespace (or the delimiter set for the scanner). When the user inputs '00', '50', or '05' without a space, the entire string is read as a single token. Since these are valid doubles (0.0, 50.0, 5.0), the first call to `input.nextDouble()` consumes the entire input string. The subsequent call to `input.nextDouble()` attempts to read the *next* token, which, unless provided by the user immediately after, results in a crash (InputMismatchException or NoSuchElementException if the input stream terminates) or waits indefinitely. Crucially, in the provided sample run where the program successfully completes, the user input must have been whitespace-delimited, for example, '0 0' then '5 0' then '0 5', despite the sample prompt implying otherwise.",
          "error_manifestation": "Runtime error (InputMismatchException/NoSuchElementException) if the input stream terminates after the single non-space-delimited token, or incorrect variable assignment if the user provides 6 subsequent whitespace-separated tokens (e.g., if '00' meant the user typed '0 0'). Assuming the student followed the sample output literally ('(x1, y1):00'), the expected behavior results in a `NoSuchElementException` on the second `nextDouble()` call for each pair, which is a major execution flow error.",
