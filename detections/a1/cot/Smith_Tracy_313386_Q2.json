          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that variables used directly as inputs (like 'm' for MPG) should not be directly used in conditional checks or complex mathematical expressions, especially if there is a risk of division by zero. Therefore, they create a separate temporary variable 't' to hold the value of 'm' before performing the check and the subsequent calculation, ensuring the 'original' value of 'm' remains isolated and pristine.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, primitive variables like the double 'm' are passed by value and are not modified when used in expressions or conditional statements. Creating the variable 't' as a direct copy of 'm' is entirely redundant and demonstrates a misunderstanding of how variable usage differs from variable reassignment (mutation). The condition `if (m != 0.0)` and the calculation `c = (d / m) * p;` would have been functionally identical and cleaner.",
