          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that when using consecutive `nextDouble()` calls separated by a prompt, the user is expected to input both values (x and y) immediately adjacent without any intervening space or delimiter, and that the Scanner will automatically treat the first digit(s) as the first variable and the subsequent digit(s) as the second variable, even if they form a single sequence of characters (e.g., inputting '50' for x and y).",
          "conceptual_gap": "The Java `Scanner` reads tokens based on a delimiter (whitespace by default, including spaces, tabs, and newlines). When `input.nextDouble()` is called, it consumes digits until it hits a non-numeric character or a delimiter. If the user types '50' and presses Enter, the entire sequence '50' is treated as a single token for the first `input.nextDouble()` call, setting x1 = 50.0. The second `input.nextDouble()` call immediately follows, but there are no remaining tokens on that line for it to read, causing it to block or look for the next input, potentially leading to immediate or unexpected input behavior depending on the runtime environment, or treating subsequent separate inputs as the missing y value.",
          "error_manifestation": "Logical error resulting in side lengths and area calculation based on incorrect coordinate values (e.g., (50, 0) instead of (5, 0)), leading to wrong output.",
