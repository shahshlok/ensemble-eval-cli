          "conceptual_gap": "In reality, the `Scanner` object's `nextDouble()` method reads the very next token available in the input stream (separated by whitespace or other delimiters). The student's code structure (interspersing prompts with `nextDouble()` calls) forces the user to provide all six input values immediately after the first prompt if they enter them on a single line, or it requires the user to hit enter after the first two inputs before the next prompt appears. The student's input handling is overly rigid and dependent on specific user behavior, especially concerning how they read two variables (`x1`, `y1`) immediately after a single prompt using `input.nextDouble(); input.nextDouble();` without considering how the input `00` is parsed (as a single token, 0.0) when followed by expected sequential prompts.",
