They may also think that both parts need to be written out explicitly so Java will \"decide\" between them at runtime, rather than realizing that the overall expression is always true.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The gap is in understanding how boolean logic and conditional expressions work in Java. In Java, `||` is logical OR, so the expression `price_per_gallon != 0 || price_per_gallon == 0` is a tautology: for any double value, it is either equal to zero or not equal to zero, so the whole condition is always true. The if-statement therefore does not restrict execution at all; it is equivalent to having no if-statement around the multiplication. The student seems not to reason about the truth table of the expression as a whole and instead treats the two comparisons as separate runtime \"paths\" that Java will choose between, rather than as components of a single boolean expression that is evaluated to one true/false result.",

Furthermore, the student believes that checking for `mpg != 0` is necessary for robustness (which is true), but the second check is unnecessary clutter.",
