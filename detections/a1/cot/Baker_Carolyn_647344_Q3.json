          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, the expression `sum_val != 0.0 || sum_val == 0.0` is a tautology: for any non-NaN double value, it is always true because a number is either equal to zero or not equal to zero. Thus, this `if` statement does not restrict execution at all; the body will run every time, making it equivalent to omitting the `if`. The gap is a misunderstanding of boolean logic and the semantics of `||` (logical OR). The student appears to think this compound condition adds meaningful control flow, when in reality it is redundant and does nothing beyond complicating the code. Correct reasoning would recognize that if a guard is intended (e.g., checking for non-negative values before `sqrt`), the condition must express that property explicitly (e.g., `sum_val >= 0`) and that `a != 0 || a == 0` is always true.",

This renders the `if` statement entirely redundant, as the distance calculation will occur unconditionally. Furthermore, because `sum_val` is derived from squaring and summing real numbers, it is mathematically guaranteed to be non-negative, meaning no check is necessary before calling `Math.sqrt()` to prevent domain errors.",

The student's mental model seems to treat the condition as a meaningful guard around Math.sqrt, rather than understanding that this particular boolean expression does not filter any cases at all.
