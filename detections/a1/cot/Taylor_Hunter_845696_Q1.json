          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that complex algebraic formulas must be translated into code by assigning every intermediate component (numerator, denominator) to distinct temporary variables before the final operation can be performed. This suggests a rigid mental model where computation must be broken down into single-operator assignment steps, leading them to unnecessarily alias 't' as 'b'.",
          "conceptual_gap": "Java allows for complex expression evaluation obeying operator precedence, meaning the calculation could be correctly and efficiently performed in a single line (`double c = (v1 - v0) / t;`). The student fails to utilize this feature, treating the variables `a` and `b` as essential placeholders rather than recognizing the redundancy, particularly in the statement `b = t;`.",
