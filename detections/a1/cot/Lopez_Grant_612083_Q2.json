          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, a boolean condition is just a logical expression evaluated to true or false; it is not a special safety construct. The expression `p != 0.0 || p == 0.0` is a tautology and will *always* evaluate to true for any double `p`, so the body of the `if` runs unconditionally. This does not give any extra safety. Moreover, only division or modulus by zero are problematic for primitives (and even then, for `double`, they yield Infinity/NaN rather than throwing an exception); multiplication by zero is perfectly well-defined. The student\u2019s code suggests a mental model where zero in any arithmetic might cause an error and where writing an `if` that lists both equality and inequality somehow creates a necessary guard, rather than understanding that such a condition is logically redundant and equivalent to omitting the `if` entirely.",
