          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that calling `x.nextDouble()` multiple times immediately after a `print` statement will prompt the user separately for each required input value, perhaps assuming the Scanner object will wait for a new line or carriage return between each call, effectively handling 'x' and 'y' input separately after the prompt.",
          "conceptual_gap": "When using `nextDouble()` on a `Scanner` object sourced from `System.in`, consecutive calls consume tokens (whitespace-separated inputs) sequentially from the input buffer without explicit prompts. If the input for a single prompt line (like `(x1, y1):00`) contains multiple numbers separated by whitespace (or no whitespace if tokens are merged, as in the example), the subsequent `nextDouble()` calls will immediately consume the next available token(s) without needing a new user interaction or prompt.",
          "error_manifestation": "Input interpretation leads to variable assignment mismatch. The inputs intended for (x, y) coordinates are mistakenly consumed from a single line of input tokens immediately supplied by the user, leading to incorrect coordinates being stored.",
