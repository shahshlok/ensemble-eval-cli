          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that in breaking down a complex formula into sequential steps (a, b, then c), every factor required for the final step `c = a * b` must be redefined and assigned to a new, intermediate variable, even if that factor already exists as a meaningful, named input variable (e.g., assigning `pricePerGallonInDollars` to `b`). This suggests a rigid, mandatory stepwise execution model tied to arbitrary variable names.",
          "conceptual_gap": "Java allows direct use of existing variables in expressions. The assignment of `pricePerGallonInDollars` to a new variable `b` is entirely redundant. The program could efficiently calculate `c = a * pricePerGallonInDollars`. The unnecessary creation of `b` indicates a failure to recognize variable references as sufficient for calculation, favoring instead a rigid instructional breakdown structure (a, b, c).",
