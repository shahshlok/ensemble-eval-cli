Consequently, they insert a defensive check (`if (sum >= 0.0)`) to ensure the argument to the square root function is always valid or to default the result to zero if an invalid state is encountered.",

In standard Java IEEE 754 double precision arithmetic, squaring and summing standard doubles will also yield a non-negative result. The conditional check `if (sum >= 0.0)` is therefore redundant and unnecessary for calculating distance, indicating a lack of confidence in, or misunderstanding of, the mathematical stability of fundamental floating-point arithmetic operations (specifically, that x^2 >= 0).",

In the provided trace, the numbers intended for x and y coordinates (0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5) are incorrectly assigned due to the user's input style ('00', '50', '05'). The first input '00' is read entirely by x1 (resulting in x1=0.0). Then y1 attempts to read the next token, which is '50'. This causes a chain reaction of assignment errors.",
