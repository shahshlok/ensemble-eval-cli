The notional-misconception is about how boolean expressions control flow: the student seems to treat the presence of an if-condition that references a variable as a general 'safety check', without reasoning about the actual truth table of the expression. They are not mentally simulating Java's evaluation of logical OR (||) and the fact that combining a predicate with its exact negation using OR yields an always-true condition. As a result, they think they are validating or guarding the multiplication by pricePerGallon, but in reality the code inside the if always executes and the condition has no effect on program behavior.",

The student\u2019s mental model treats the two comparisons as if they were independent checks that somehow make the code \"safer\" by listing all cases, rather than realizing that listing mutually exclusive cases with OR collapses to an always-true condition.
