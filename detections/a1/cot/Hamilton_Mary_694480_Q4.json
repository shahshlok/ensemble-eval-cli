          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that calling `n.nextDouble()` after a `System.out.print` prompt will consume only the next numerical input, and if the user enters multiple numbers on the same line (e.g., '00' when prompted for (x1, y1), where 0 and 0 are separate inputs), the subsequent `n.nextDouble()` call will automatically retrieve the next number from that buffered line without requiring a new prompt or input line.",
          "conceptual_gap": "While the Scanner often handles tokenization across whitespace (including user inputting multiple numbers on one line), the code relies on implicit sequential token reading. The key conceptual failure here is the mismatch between the prompt sequence and the input consumption sequence. The student writes:\n1. `System.out.print(\"(x1, y1):\");` (Prints prompt)\n2. `double x1 = n.nextDouble();` (Waits for and consumes first token, e.g., '0')\n3. `double y1 = n.nextDouble();` (Immediately consumes second token, e.g., '0', potentially from the same line, bypassing the next expected prompt/input opportunity).\n\nThe student mistakenly aligns the two sequential `nextDouble()` calls corresponding to (x, y) pairs *after* a single prompt, causing the input for 'y' to be consumed immediately after 'x' without a new prompt, which violates the intended sequential user experience documented in the sample run.",
          "error_manifestation": "The program successfully calculates the area but the I/O interaction with the user is incorrect compared to standard practice and the sample run. Two input values (x, y) are consumed for each single coordinate prompt.",
