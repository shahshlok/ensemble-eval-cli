          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that a value obtained directly from an external source, like a Scanner input method, should first be stored in a temporary variable (e.g., `distanceInput`) and then immediately copied to the intended variable (e.g., `distance`) for use in calculations. This suggests a perceived fragility or instability of the direct input variable.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, when a primitive variable is assigned the result of a method call (e.g., `double distance = scanner.nextDouble();`), the value is stored permanently and stably in that variable. Creating a second variable solely to copy the value from the first variable is entirely redundant, demonstrating a misunderstanding that the input variable is immediately reliable and ready for use.",
