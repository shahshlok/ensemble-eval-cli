They believe that variables must be explicitly defined for components that are already defined, such as variable `t` being copied to `b`.",
          "conceptual_gap": "Java allows for complex arithmetic expressions to be evaluated fully in a single statement, utilizing operator precedence correctly (e.g., `acceleration = (v1 - v0) / t;`). The student's execution model requires manual creation of storage for transient values (`a`, `b`, `c`) and unnecessary copying (`b = t;` and `acceleration = c;`), indicating a failure to trust or utilize Java's capability for expression evaluation.",
