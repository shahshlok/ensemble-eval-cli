          "conceptual_gap": "Input parameters (v0, v1, and t) are mandatory prerequisites for the calculation described in the task. By assigning these critical variables conditionally (lines 12, 17, 22) after initializing them to 0.0 (lines 8, 9, 10), the student allows the program to proceed with missing input, substituting the required user value with 0.0. This structure prevents the program from accurately calculating acceleration if fewer than three inputs are provided, as it treats missing input tokens as a zero value for the respective variable, rather than enforcing input fulfillment or handling the error explicitly.",

          "conceptual_gap": "While checking with `hasNextDouble()` ensures safety against invalid input type exceptions (like InputMismatchException), it is redundant in this context because the program depends on reading exactly three values. The use of temporary variables (`temp_v0`, `temp_v1`, `temp_t`) adds unnecessary complexity and steps; the input could be assigned directly: `v0 = input.nextDouble();` This pattern suggests a lack of understanding regarding efficient variable reuse and direct assignment, possibly confusing mandatory safeguards (like null checks or complex stream handling) with simple sequential input reading.",
