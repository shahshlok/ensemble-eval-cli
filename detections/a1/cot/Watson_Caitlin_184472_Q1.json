          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, complex expressions are evaluated according to operator precedence and associativity, and the use of explicit temporary variables for every arithmetic operation (subtraction, then division) is unnecessary for correctness or clarity in this context. While not resulting in functional error here, this demonstrates an inefficient mental model regarding expression evaluation and variable usage for straightforward formula application.",
