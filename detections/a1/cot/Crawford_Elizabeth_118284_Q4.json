          "conceptual_gap": "The Java `Scanner` operates by tokenization, which typically uses whitespace or newlines as delimiters. A single input like '00' is parsed as one token, the `double` 0.0. The first `nextDouble()` call consumes this token, while the second `nextDouble()` call waits indefinitely (or until the next available token) because it requires a distinct, separate token. The student's model confuses character-level reading with token-level reading.",

          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that when using `Scanner.nextDouble()`, sequential inputs from the user are guaranteed to correspond exactly one-to-one with the calls to `nextDouble()` after a prompt, regardless of how the user formats the input (e.g., entering '00' on a single line for two separate `nextDouble()` calls). The student expects the input stream processing logic to automatically parse adjacent digits intended for different variables in separate calls.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student fails to understand how `Scanner.nextDouble()` processes input when the prompt structure suggests independent X and Y values but the user provides consolidated input (e.g., '00'). The sample run shows the user providing '00' for the first prompt, which the `Scanner` attempts to parse. Since '00' is successfully read as a single `double` (which evaluates to 0.0), it satisfies the first `input.nextDouble()` call (for `x1`). However, the input stream contains no delimiter (like space or newline) separating this input from the next required input (`y1`). Subsequently, the next `input.nextDouble()` call for `y1` waits for new input, causing divergence from the expected output sequence.",
          "error_manifestation": "Incorrect output (12.5 vs expected 0.0) due to mismatched input variables (assigning an unintended 0.0 value to x1 and y1, but primarily requiring the user to supply extra, unanticipated input lines). More accurately, the program hangs/awaits input unexpectedly because the first call (`x1`) consumes the entire '00' token (0.0), and the second call (`y1`) finds no subsequent token, requiring a second, silent input line.",
