          "conceptual_gap": "Java's `Scanner.nextDouble()` consumes exactly one token, delimited by whitespace. To satisfy lines 14 and 15, the user must provide two distinct input tokens (e.g., '0 0' or '0\\n0'). If the user enters only '00' followed by Enter, the first `nextDouble()` (L14) consumes '0.0', and the second `nextDouble()` (L15) blocks indefinitely waiting for the required second token. This prevents the program from progressing to print the subsequent prompt (L18). The structure of the surrounding I/O encourages user input that will cause the program to hang.",

          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that when a `Scanner` object's `nextDouble()` method is called repeatedly immediately after a single `System.out.print` prompt, the user must input all required values on a single line sequentially, separated only by spaces or acceptable delimiters, and that those values will be assigned in order to the subsequent variable declarations. Specifically, they expect that if two `nextDouble()` calls follow one prompt, the user will input two values simultaneously (e.g., '0 0' for '00'), and the code will parse them correctly.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The code structure separates the prompt and the input parsing: `System.out.print(\"(x1, y1):\"); double pointOneXValue = userInputScanner.nextDouble(); double pointOneYValue = userInputScanner.nextDouble();`. This structure is mathematically correct for reading two numbers. However, the student's expected input matching the sample run `(x1, y1):00` implies that they anticipate a non-standard input format (like '00' being parsed as two separate '0's) or failing to recognize that standard user input requires two distinct tokens (like '0 0' or '0\n0'). The sample run likely uses inputs like '0 0', '5 0', and '0 5' which are interpreted correctly by the two sequential calls to `nextDouble()`. The student code handles input parsing correctly for standard space-delimited or newline-delimited tokens, but the prompt structure and the provided sample output format suggest an underlying assumption about how users provide multiple inputs following a single prompt, which might be confusing or lead to runtime errors if the user inputs `00` literally.",
          "error_manifestation": "Potential runtime error (`InputMismatchException`) or incorrect value assignment if the user strictly follows the sample run's ambiguous input display (e.g., typing '00' instead of '0 0'). Since all necessary input calls are present, if the user provides standard tokenized input (e.g., '0 0', '5 0', '0 5'), the code will execute successfully.",
