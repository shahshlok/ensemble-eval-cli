          "conceptual_gap": "The student misunderstands the interactive nature of sequential input reading via `Scanner`. The code prints the prompt (L11), reads `x1` (L12), and then silently waits for the second input token for `y1` (L13) without providing any further feedback. This leads to a poor user experience where the program appears to freeze, waiting for the remainder of the input for the first point before printing the prompt for the second point (L15). The user is not prompted explicitly for the second coordinate.",

          "conceptual_gap": "The `Scanner.nextDouble()` method only consumes the next token that can be parsed as a double. When the user enters '00' for the first prompt, the first `input.nextDouble()` (L11) reads the integer 0, and the second `input.nextDouble()` (L12) reads the integer 0. The student's code structure assumes that the user will follow the prompt format (e.g., entering 'x y' after '(x1, y1):') naturally, but the sample run shows concatenated input '00', '50', '05', which is parsed correctly by sheer luck in this specific case because the user entered integers that resulted in valid coordinates when split by the reading pattern, but is highly fragile and doesn't follow standard input expectations for pairs.",
          "error_manifestation": "Input processing is brittle and deviates significantly from standard interaction protocols. Although the *values* read match the geometric intent of the sample run (0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5), the input technique ('00' concatenated input parsed as two '0's) demonstrates a misunderstanding of how `nextDouble()` consumes input tokens, especially when attempting to read coordinates based on single prompts.",
