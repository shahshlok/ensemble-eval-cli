          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that when two consecutive numbers are required after a single prompt, entering two digits immediately next to one another (e.g., '00') will be automatically parsed by `Scanner.nextDouble()` as two distinct numerical tokens (0.0 and 0.0), even without intervening whitespace separators.",
          "conceptual_gap": "Java's `Scanner` uses whitespace (spaces, tabs, newlines) as the default delimiter for tokenization. When the input stream receives '00' followed by a delimiter (like a newline), it reads '00' as a single token, which is parsed into the double value 0.0 for `x1`. The subsequent call to `nextDouble()` for `y1` would then fail or hang, as no further numerical token exists in the stream. To correctly read two distinct values (x and y) from the same input line, the user must separate them with whitespace (e.g., '0 0'). The input method shown in the sample run ('00', '50', '05') suggests the student may rely on improper tokenization.",
          "error_manifestation": "Program blocks waiting for input or crashes with an InputMismatchException if the user types inputs lacking whitespace separators, resulting in a divergence between the student's expected input flow and the actual requirement of the `Scanner` class.",
