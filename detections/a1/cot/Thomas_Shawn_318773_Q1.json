If the check fails, the program should continue using the variable's default initialized value (0.0), thereby achieving robustness and preventing crashes, even if the result is mathematically incorrect.",
          "conceptual_gap": "For problems requiring a specific set of inputs for calculation (mandatory parameters), conditional checks that silently fail lead to logical errors (wrong output due to using 0.0). The student fails to understand that mandatory required input typically needs to be ensured (via direct calls or input loops) rather than merely conditionally checked, especially when the default value is a potential calculation input (like 0.0, which could cause Division by Zero if 't' is missed). The structure prevents the required data from being guaranteed.",

Crucially, they seem to believe that checking `input.hasNextDouble()` three times in a sequence of conditional statements, where the input is provided simultaneously (e.g., '3 30.4 1.5'), guarantees that all three numbers are consumed sequentially by the separate conditional blocks, even if that input structure is unusual compared to direct sequential reads.",
          "conceptual_gap": "While the code correctly reads three sequential doubles from the input stream, the use of separate `if (input.hasNextDouble())` blocks is unnecessary and implies a misunderstanding of how `Scanner` processes multiple tokens provided on a single line or in a rapid sequence. `Scanner` processes the input stream sequentially, and the three separate checks are redundant when the user supplies all data at once. If the user only provided one number (e.g., '3'), the code would read '3' into `v0`, but `v1` and `t` would remain 0.0 because the subsequent `hasNextDouble()` calls would fail, leading to an incorrect calculation (acceleration = (0 - 3) / 0 = NaN or Division by Zero error depending on the `if (t != 0.0)` block, but here it simply uses `v1=0` and `t=0`, resulting in `acceleration=0.0`). The student uses temporary variables (`temp_v0`, `temp_v1`, `temp_t`) unnecessarily inside the blocks, perhaps demonstrating caution or confusion about variable scope, but mostly, the flaw is in structuring input using multiple separate, redundant checks for data that is expected to be present sequentially.",
          "error_manifestation": "No functional error for the expected use case, but the structure is overly defensive and inefficient, indicating a flawed mental model of sequential input processing.",
