          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that variable identifiers are interchangeable or that specific naming patterns (like using 'y' for the first coordinate and 'n' for the second) are fine, but they lack a coherent semantic map of which variable corresponds to which geometric coordinate ($x_1$, $y_1$, $x_2$, $y_2$). Specifically, they mixed up the difference calculations later. They assigned $x_1$ to `y` and $y_1$ to `n`. While this is bad practice, the calculations `c = a-y` and `d = b-n` are correct given the assignments: `c = x_2 - x_1` and `d = y_2 - y_1$. The misconception lies solely in the poor choice of identifiers, which does not cause a mathematical error here, but demonstrates poor variable semantics.",
          "conceptual_gap": "While Java allows arbitrary valid identifiers for variables, good programming practice requires meaningful names to map concepts accurately. Since the calculations (`c=a-y` and `d=b-n`) correctly use the assigned values for $x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2$ based on input order, this particular implementation works accidentally despite the ambiguous naming (`y` for $x_1$, `n` for $y_1$, `a` for $x_2$, `b` for $y_2$). The gap is between the student's expectation that arbitrary single letters are sufficient, and the necessity of maintaining a clear mental mapping between mathematical concepts and code variables.",
          "error_manifestation": "Wrong variable names are used for concepts ($x_1$ stored in `y`, $y_1$ stored in `n`). This increases cognitive load and risks errors in larger programs, although it does not cause incorrect output in this specific, small program.",
