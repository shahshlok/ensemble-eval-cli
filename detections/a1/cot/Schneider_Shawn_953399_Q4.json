          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that when multiple `input.nextInt()` calls follow a single `System.out.print()` prompt, the user is expected to provide all required inputs on a single line, and that the single line entry format (e.g., `00`) cleanly maps the first character/number to the first variable and the second character/number to the second variable, effectively reading characters individually as digits.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The Java `Scanner.nextInt()` method waits for and parses the next complete integer token available in the input stream, regardless of how many digits constitute that token. When the user enters `00` and hits enter, Java treats this as a sequence of tokens. The first call to `nextInt()` consumes the first `0`, and the second call immediately consumes the remaining `0` without needing a second input line or space separation. This behavior differs from expecting two explicitly separate inputs or relying on fixed-width character reading.",
          "error_manifestation": "Hidden behavior divergence, as the output matches the expected result (due to the simple inputs used), but the input handling logic (lines 7-8, 11-12, 15-16) relies on the user entering concatenated digits (e.g., `00` instead of `0 0`) or entering them sequentially on the prompt line, which is unexpected given standard prompting methods.",
