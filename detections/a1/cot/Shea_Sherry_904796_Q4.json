          "conceptual_gap": "While closing a Scanner is necessary for files or network streams, closing a Scanner wrapped around System.in (the standard input stream) also closes the underlying global stream. Standard practice is to avoid closing System.in, as it is a global resource that the operating system manages and the JVM handles upon exit. Closing System.in can lead to resource closure errors if subsequent parts of the application or external libraries attempt to read from standard input.",

          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that when they use `userInputScanner.nextDouble()` twice sequentially, the input is read character by character or line by line specifically, forcing the user to press Enter after the first coordinate and then supply the second coordinate (or that `nextDouble()` consumes exactly one digit/number per call, regardless of how many tokens are present on the input line). They likely assume that in the sample run input, '00' corresponds to (x1, y1) where the input reading mechanism somehow stops at the first '0' for x1 and takes the second '0' for y1. This is necessary for the resulting area calculation to match the sample output (12.5).",
          "conceptual_gap": "The `Scanner` class tokenizes input based on delimiters (whitespace by default, including spaces, tabs, and newlines). When reading interactive input, if the user types `00` and presses enter, this entire sequence is generally treated as a *single* token (the number 0.0 or 0, depending on the context of the user interaction and immediate input stream interpretation). Since `nextDouble()` is called twice, if the user provides `0 0`, the scanner reads `0.0` then `0.0`. If the user provides `00` and presses enter, the scanner ideally reads `0.0` (or `0`) and then stalls waiting for the second value, as `00` is one contiguous token representing the number zero. To achieve the sample output, the input must be interpreted as '0' then '0', then '5' then '0', then '0' then '5', which requires separator characters (whitespace) that were not explicitly shown in the condensed sample run format but are required by Java's `Scanner.nextDouble()` behavior to read two tokens per line/prompt.",
          "error_manifestation": "Error in input parsing relative to the typical user interaction implied by the sample run, leading to unexpected variable values unless the user explicitly separates inputs, contradicting the appearance of the sample run's input (e.g., `(x1, y1):00`). If the user types '00', Java reads 0.0 for x1 and waits indefinitely for y1. The code is logically correct if the user inputs tokens correctly separated by space or newline (e.g., '0 0', '5 0', '0 5'). The misconception lies in how the student believes the Scanner handles contiguous input characters like '00'.",
