          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that data retrieved from an I/O operation (like `userInputScanner.nextDouble()`) must first be stored in a temporary 'Input' variable, which is then immediately copied into a separate, permanent variable for processing. Similarly, the student believes that complex algebraic expressions must be broken down, with each atomic calculation step (e.g., subtraction, division) requiring its own unique intermediate 'Holder' variable before the final result can be assigned.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java (and most high-level languages), variables are flexible memory locations. A single variable can directly store an input value (making the copy step on lines 12, 16, 20 redundant), and complex expressions can be evaluated in a single line (e.g., `averageAccelerationResult = (finalVelocityV1 - startingVelocityV0) / timeIntervalT;`), eliminating the need for single-operation 'Holder' variables (L31, L34). This pattern suggests the student views variables as single-purpose registers necessary for one atomic operation before passing the value along, rather than reusable storage locations that can handle complex expressions directly.",
          "error_manifestation": "Code is extremely verbose, inefficient, and contains excessive, unused local variables, although the final output is mathematically correct.",
