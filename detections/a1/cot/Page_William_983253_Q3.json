They also seem to believe that initializing the variables to 0 first is sufficient, and the Scanner will overwrite those values behind the scenes.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, input methods like nextDouble() do not magically fill existing variables; they simply return a value. To actually store the input, the returned value must be assigned explicitly to a variable, e.g., x1 = x.nextDouble();. In this program, the execution proceeds as follows:\n\n- Line 4: Scanner x is created.\n- Line 5: Prompt printed: \"Enter x1 and y1: \".\n- Line 6: x1 and y1 are both initialized to 0.0.\n- Line 7: x.nextDouble() is called twice, but both returned values are ignored; x1 and y1 stay 0.0.\n- Line 8: Prompt printed: \"Enter x2 and y2: \".\n- Line 9: x2 and y2 are both initialized to 0.0.\n- Line 10: x.nextDouble() is called twice again, and again the returned values are ignored; x2 and y2 remain 0.0.\n- Line 11: d is computed as Math.sqrt((0-0)^2 + (0-0)^2) = 0.0.\n\nSo, regardless of what the user types, all four coordinates stay at their initial value 0.0. The gap is that the student is missing the idea that variable values never change unless there is an explicit assignment; merely calling an input method does not connect it to specific variables.",
