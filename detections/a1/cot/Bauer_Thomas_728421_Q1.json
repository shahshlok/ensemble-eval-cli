          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that variables assigned directly from external I/O (like `Scanner.nextDouble()`) are 'raw', 'unstable', or require intermediate processing, compelling them to explicitly copy or buffer them into a separate variable (e.g., `v0Input` to `startingVelocityV0`) before using them in computation or logical checks. They perceive the copy as a necessary 'Temporary holder variable' or a 'safe' version.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, assigning a value to a variable makes that value stable and safe for subsequent calculations within its scope. Creating immediate, sequential copies of variables read from input is entirely redundant and does not confer any computational safety or persistence benefit. The original variable is suitable for use immediately.",

The student's use of intermediate 'Input' variables followed by immediate assignment to new variables labeled 'Temporary holder variable' or just using the original value later (like `timeT` being copied to `safeTimeT`) is unnecessary overhead. This indicates a misunderstanding of variable scope and data stability after initial assignment.",
