They assume the expression will be evaluated like the mathematical fraction they have in mind, not according to Java's fixed precedence rules.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java (and most programming languages), arithmetic expressions obey strict operator precedence: multiplication and division are evaluated before addition and subtraction, and expressions are evaluated left-to-right within the same precedence level. Thus `side1 + side2 + side3 / 2.0` is actually computed as `side1 + side2 + (side3 / 2.0)`, not `(side1 + side2 + side3) / 2.0`. To match the mathematical formula `s = (side1 + side2 + side3) / 2`, the sum must be explicitly grouped with parentheses, e.g., `semiPerimeterValue = (side1 + side2 + side3) / 2.0;` or by using the already computed `sumOfSidesValue / 2.0`.
