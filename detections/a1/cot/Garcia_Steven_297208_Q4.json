          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that printing a prompt and calling `userInputScanner.nextDouble()` twice on subsequent lines will prompt for and read two distinct numbers from two separate input lines or two separate user input interactions, assuming the input stream is consumed exactly how the prompts are structured.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The Java `Scanner` reads tokens based on whitespace delimiters (space, tab, newline). When `nextDouble()` is called sequentially, if the user provides multiple tokens (like '00' or '0 0') in response to the *first* prompt, the Scanner consumes them immediately. If the user enters '00' corresponding to (x1, y1) as shown in the Sample Run, the '0' is read for x1, and the subsequent '0' (the second token, separated by nothing but interpreted as two zeros if the input stream resolves '00' to two tokens, or if it is followed by a space) is immediately read for y1, regardless of whether a new prompt for (x2, y2) has been printed yet. The student incorrectly assumes the program state (printing the next prompt) dictates when the Scanner looks for the next token.",
          "error_manifestation": "The visual interaction diverged from the student's expectation based on the prompts. Several prompts were printed before the corresponding input was buffered/consumed, leading to visual grouping of input tokens, although the final mathematical result was correct for the sample input.",
