This leads to redundant assignments. Crucially, they confuse the symbolic role of variables from the formula $a=\frac{v_{1}-v_{0}}{t}$, incorrectly using the variable 'a' (representing acceleration in the formula) to store the value of timeT.",
          "conceptual_gap": "Variables in Java should be used based on their program context, meaning, and scope, not arbitrarily mapped to single letters found in an introductory algebra formula. Assigning descriptive variables (`timeT`, `finalVelocityV1`) to temporary, non-descriptive variables (`a`, `b`) before calculation is unnecessary. The specific failure to maintain the meaning of 'a' as acceleration demonstrates a weak understanding of how to translate symbolic mathematical relationships consistently into executable code identifiers.",

          "conceptual_gap": "The student has conflated mathematical formula symbols with Java variable naming conventions. In mathematics, 'a' represents the result (acceleration), but in the code, 'a' is reassigned to hold the denominator (time). This breaks the semantic connection between variable name and purpose, violating Java best practices where variable names should reflect their content and role. While the code executes correctly, the mental model shows a misunderstanding of how to map formulas to code through meaningful naming.",
