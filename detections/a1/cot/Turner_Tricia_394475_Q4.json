This implies the student views the input phase as a single atomic step corresponding to the prompt.",

          "conceptual_gap": "The student's prompts suggest a user input format like `(x1, y1):X Y` where X and Y are entered sequentially after the prompt. However, the sample run shows the format `(x1, y1):00` and later `(x2, y2):50`. If the user inputs two values immediately after one prompt (e.g., `(x1, y1):0 0`), the first call to `userInputScanner.next()` consumes '0', and the second call to `userInputScanner.next()` immediately consumes the second '0' *without* waiting for new input or a new prompt, leading to confusion about which prompt corresponds to which input variable, especially when the input reading logic doesn't align with the display logic.",

This implies a belief that `Scanner.nextDouble()` might handle certain input formats incorrectly (like '00') or might be less flexible than manual parsing, or perhaps confusion about parsing mechanics in general.",
          "conceptual_gap": "While reading `00` using `nextDouble()` is perfectly fine (it results in 0.0), the student introduces unnecessary complexity by reading into a String and then parsing to a Double. This is often seen when students mistakenly believe `Scanner.nextDouble()` cannot handle specific string-like attributes of input or if they are attempting to mirror file reading patterns in interactive console reading. The use of `Double.parseDouble()` on line 16, following the reading of a String on line 15, is not inherently wrong but represents a redundant step that reveals a lack of confidence or understanding regarding the direct numeric input capabilities of the `Scanner` class.",
