          "conceptual_gap": "The student correctly reuses the temporary variables `x` and `y` for scanning input for coordinates (x2, y2) and (x3, y3). However, they also initialize `x1 = x` and `y1 = y` immediately after reading the first point, but for the second and third points, they read into the reused temporary variables `x` and `y` and then use those values directly (`x2 = x`, `y2 = y`, etc.) but fail to handle the input reading for the two coordinates in a single consistent manner relative to the prompt structure. More critically, the student fails to realize that the structure of the input reading means that when the user types a stream of input (`0 0 5 0 0 5`), the variables `x` and `y` are correctly assigned, but the variable reuse is unnecessarily complex given the goal is just to store six distinct coordinates.",

          "conceptual_gap": "In Java's floating-point arithmetic (using `double`), dividing a non-zero number by 2.0 is safe. Furthermore, `p` (the sum of side lengths) must be positive for any valid triangle (or zero for a degenerate point), so the check `if (p != 0)` is mathematically unnecessary and potentially confusing. Likewise, `r` is the product $s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)$, which must be non-negative by Heron's formula definition. If $r$ were negative (due to floating point errors or invalid inputs), `Math.sqrt(r)` would result in `NaN`, which is often acceptable for robust error indication. Explicitly checking for $r=0$ is also redundant as `Math.sqrt(0)` is 0.",
