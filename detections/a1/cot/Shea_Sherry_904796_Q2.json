At line 18, totalCostOfDriving is computed as NaN * 0.0, which is still NaN, and that NaN is stored as a fixed value. Later, when the program executes lines 22, 26, and 30, it changes the input variables, but Java does not retroactively recompute gallonsOfFuelUsed or totalCostOfDriving. Assignments do not store a formula; they store the result of evaluating the right-hand side at that moment. The print statement at line 33 simply uses the already-computed NaN.
