          "conceptual_gap": "For sequential, mandatory inputs (like the three required variables $v_0, v_1, t$), repeatedly wrapping each `nextDouble()` call in an `if (hasNextDouble())` block introduces resilience to partial input. This is not inherently wrong but is unusual for fixed-format input. The conceptual failure lies in relying on the initial variable initialization (`v=0, w=0, t=0`) to serve as a silent fallback mechanism if input tokens are missing, thereby hiding potential input errors from the user and causing calculations to proceed with zero values if the input stream runs short.",
          "error_manifestation": "The calculation may result in an incorrect output (often 0 or a calculation based on 0) if the user provides fewer than three valid double values, as the corresponding variable will retain its initialized value of 0.0.",

          "conceptual_gap": "While using checking methods (`hasNextDouble()`) is good practice when anticipating malformed input or mixed types, when reading a sequence of expected types (as implied by the required input format), preceding every `nextDouble()` call with a check is redundant and verbose if the code relies on the user providing exactly three numbers when prompted.
