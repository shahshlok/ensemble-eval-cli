The mathematical distance formula naturally handles the case where distance is zero without special conditional logic.

They are treating `n*n+m*m` potentially being zero as a special case that requires explicit handling before calculating the square root.",

Furthermore, if the points are identical, the required distance is zero, which is the mathematically correct result `d=0`. The structure `if(n!=0||m!=0)d=Math.sqrt(n*n+m*m);` is redundant and potentially misleading, as initializing `d=0` (L14) and only updating it if points are different achieves nothing that standard distance calculation wouldn't inherently handle.",
