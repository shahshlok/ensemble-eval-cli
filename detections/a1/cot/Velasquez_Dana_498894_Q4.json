The student fails to recognize that a general, reusable procedure (method) can be defined to calculate distance given any four coordinate inputs.",

In the Java notional machine, mathematical procedures like distance calculation are ideally encapsulated in reusable methods, independent of the variable names supplied (x1, y1, x2, y2, etc.). By repeating the exact mathematical calculation three times, the student demonstrates a failure to conceive of the calculation logic as a standalone, context-agnostic computational step.",

          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that printing the prompt `(x1, y1):` once will guide the user to enter `x1` and `y1` on the same line, but that the subsequent execution flow (reading two doubles) will automatically recognize the pairing and wait for input only when necessary before switching to the next prompt (`(x2, y2):`). Crucially, the student assumes that the single print statement `System.out.print(\"(x1, y1):\");` is sufficient to prompt the input for both `x1` and `y1`, and that separate prompts are not necessary for variables read sequentially using `x.nextDouble()` calls on the same line.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The Java `Scanner` method `nextDouble()` consumes and returns the next token from the input stream. While multiple tokens can be read successfully if they are present (e.g., entered on the same line separated by spaces or newlines), the program execution flows continuously. The code `double x1=x.nextDouble(),y1=x.nextDouble();` executes the first `nextDouble()` call, then immediately executes the second `nextDouble()` call. Since the prompt `(x1, y1):` was only displayed before the first call, the input stream is read twice *before* the prompt for `(x2, y2)` is displayed. This causes the student's program to read the input intended for `y1` without a specific preceding prompt, violating the expected input sequence visibility shown in the sample run.",
          "error_manifestation": "Wrong output prompt sequence compared to the sample run, leading to user confusion and potentially incorrect input token pairing if the user does not enter the coordinates on a single line.",
