The student expects the program to consume both the X and Y inputs associated with that coordinate pair before proceeding to execute and display the next coordinate prompt (`(x2, y2):` on Line 11).",
          "conceptual_gap": "Java executes statements sequentially. If the user enters only the X coordinate and hits Enter, Line 8 executes, but Line 9 (reading Y) blocks until the next token is available. While Line 9 is waiting, the instructions do not require the user to input anything, and the program immediately proceeds to execute Line 11, thus displaying the prompt for the *second* coordinate pair (`(x2, y2):`) even though the first pair's Y coordinate (`y1`) has not been read yet. This overlapping I/O leads to a confusing console experience where inputs intended for later prompts are prematurely consumed by earlier variables.",

Specifically, the student expects the user to input 'x1' and then 'y1' separately, perhaps believing the `input.nextDouble()` calls themselves create distinct input prompts, or that the sample run's compact '00' input is unusual.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The Java `Scanner` reads tokens (delimited by whitespace). When the user enters `00` (which is interpreted as a single token, the number 0.0), the first `input.nextDouble()` consumes the `0` and assigns it to `x1`. Since the user input buffer is now empty relative to the expected two tokens, the program waits for more input for the second `input.nextDouble()` call (`y1`). The student failed to account for how sequential `nextDouble()` calls consume tokens from the input stream. In the sample run structure, the user provided only one token (`00`, interpreted as `0.0`) in response to the first prompt, leading to the second `nextDouble()` waiting for a new token, disrupting the intended input prompting/reading flow.",
          "error_manifestation": "The program successfully compiles and runs but produces unexpected behavior during input collection, mixing up which input prompt corresponds to which coordinate variable (`y1` is assigned the user's input intended for `x2`, `y3` is assigned the user's input intended for `x1` repeat, etc.). If the user exactly followed the provided sample run's compact format (`00`, `50`, `05`), the program would wait for more input after processing `00` for (x1, y1).",
