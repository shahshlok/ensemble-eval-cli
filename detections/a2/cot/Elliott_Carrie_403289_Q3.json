They likely also assume that grades below 60 will be handled by some `else` in the chain or that the chain is implicitly exhaustive, so they do not notice that `< 60` prints nothing.",

As a result:\n- For `grade >= 60 && grade >= 65` (i.e., 65\u2013100, subject to earlier conditions), the inner `if` is true and prints D.\n- For `grade >= 60 && grade < 65` (60\u201364), the inner `if` is false and the `else` on line 19 runs, printing F.\n- For `grade < 60`, the outer `else if (grade >= 60)` is false, so the inner `if` and its `else` are skipped entirely, and no letter grade is printed.\n\nThe student\u2019s mental model treats indentation as if it created an implicit block after `else if (grade >= 60)`, but Java requires explicit braces to form such a block. Without braces, the outer `else if` controls only the single statement `if (grade >= 65)`, and nothing at all handles `grade < 60`.",
