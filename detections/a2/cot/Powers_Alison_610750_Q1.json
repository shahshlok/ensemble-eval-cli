          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that for an arithmetic operation like finding the remainder (modulo), every numeric component, including constant literals (like 2), must first be assigned to a distinct named variable. This rigid approach forces them to create unnecessary intermediate variables (a, b, c) instead of using literals or evaluating the expression directly (e.g., `if (userInputValue % 2 == 0)`).",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, arithmetic operations can be performed directly on variables and literal constants embedded within an expression. The student's model suggests a need for excessively strict, named staging of inputs and intermediate results, mimicking a lower-level, register-oriented programming style rather than utilizing Java's expression evaluation capabilities.",
          "error_manifestation": "The code works correctly but is overly verbose and introduces unnecessary temporary variable declarations within the loop, leading to minor inefficiencies and decreased readability.",
