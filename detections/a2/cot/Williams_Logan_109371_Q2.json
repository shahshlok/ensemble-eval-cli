          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that once the `guess == answer` condition is met and the 'Correct!' message is printed inside the loop, the loop will immediately stop executing before the next iteration might begin, regardless of the loop's `while` condition check.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student fails to understand the strict order of execution in a `while` loop: condition check -> body execution -> (repeat). Even when the correct guess is made, the loop body executes fully, prints the success message, and *only then* does it return to the `while (guess != answer)` condition check, which finally terminates the loop. The student's use of `while (guess != answer)` correctly controls repetition, but including the 'Correct!' message printing (which is the consequence of termination) *inside* the loop means this message is printed just before termination, which violates the requirement that feedback should only be provided for *wrong* guesses, or that the 'Correct!' success message should conclude the program's feedback cycle gracefully after the loop has naturally run its course or been broken.",
          "error_manifestation": "The correct output message ('Correct!') is displayed, but its placement within the loop structure is logically redundant or poorly structured, as the loop condition itself guarantees the loop will terminate immediately after that print statement, making the final `else` branch functionally equivalent to a breaking condition without explicitly using `break;`.",
