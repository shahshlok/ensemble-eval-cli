If a non-integer input is provided, `n` remains 0 (initialized on L6), and `x.nextInt()` is never called, leaving the Scanner buffer unconsumed, which is poor practice. If the student wanted robust non-integer handling, they should consume the invalid token. The unnecessary check for negative `n` indicates a lack of confidence in loop termination conditions if `n` were to be negative (though the `while` loop handles `n=0` fine).",
