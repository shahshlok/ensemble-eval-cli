The expression `n != 0 || n == 0` is a tautology (it is true for every possible `n`), so it never prevents the enclosed block from running. Similarly, with `i` initialized to 1 before the loop and only ever incremented, `i` is never 0 inside the loop, so `if (i != 0)` is also always true and thus redundant. This suggests a gap between viewing conditions as precise logical filters versus seeing them as general-purpose or required \u201cwrapping\u201d syntax that doesn't need to be logically minimal or exact.",
