          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that when defining grade boundaries using an `if-else if` ladder, every range check must explicitly include both the lower bound (e.g., `grade >= 80`) and the upper bound (e.g., `grade < 90`), ensuring a comprehensive test for boundaries in both directions.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student fails to utilize the implicit exclusion provided by the `else if` control flow. In an `else if` structure testing conditions sequentially from highest to lowest, if the execution reaches a lower grade boundary (e.g., checking for B), the program has already guaranteed that the grade did not meet the requirements for the grades above it (e.g., A). Thus, explicitly checking the upper bound (`grade < 90`) is logically redundant and makes the conditional logic unnecessarily complex.",
