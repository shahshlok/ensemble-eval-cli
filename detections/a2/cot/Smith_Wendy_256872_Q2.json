          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that simple arithmetic assignments (like incrementing a counter) must be broken down into discrete temporary variables (a, b, c) representing intermediate calculation states (read value, read constant, calculate sum) before the final value can be safely assigned back to the counter variable.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student's model unnecessarily complicates simple variable mutation. Java allows direct arithmetic operations and compound assignment operators (e.g., `totalNumberOfGuesses++` or `totalNumberOfGuesses += 1`) that are both conventional and efficient. The student demonstrates an avoidance of these simpler forms, suggesting a hesitation or misunderstanding regarding how variables can be directly modified or incremented within a single statement.",
