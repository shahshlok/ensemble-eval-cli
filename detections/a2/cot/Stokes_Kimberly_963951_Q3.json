          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that each conditional check in a graded scheme must explicitly verify both the lower and upper bounds of the range (e.g., `grade >= 80 && grade <= 89`). This implies a lack of trust in, or understanding of, the implicit boundary established by the sequential and exclusive nature of the `else if` control flow.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java's `if-else if` structure, if an `else if` block is reached, all preceding conditions must have evaluated to false. For instance, if the check for 'B' (line 14) is reached, it is guaranteed that the grade is not >= 90 (i.e., it is <= 89, since integer input is used). Explicitly checking the upper bound (`&& grade <= 89`) is redundant. The necessity of this explicit check in the student's code suggests a flawed mental model where they do not fully utilize the exclusivity inherent in the `else if` execution path.",
          "error_manifestation": "No functional error; the program executes correctly but contains unnecessary logical checks, making the solution slightly less efficient and verbose than necessary.",
