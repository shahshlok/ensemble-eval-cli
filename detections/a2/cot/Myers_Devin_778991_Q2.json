          "conceptual_gap": "The student has structured the loop (`while (userGuess != c)`) to run only when the guess is incorrect. A robust mental model would avoid performing a redundant success check (`if (diff == 0)`) inside this failure-conditioned structure. While the code works because the successful guess updates the loop variable and terminates the loop on the next condition check, the dual conditionality demonstrates a less efficient mental model of using loop control. In standard programming practice, the logic inside a `while (A)` loop typically assumes `A` is true, and handles the consequences until `A` becomes false.",

A `while` loop's execution continues until the specified condition (`userGuess != c`) is evaluated as false *at the beginning of an iteration*. Executing code inside the loop that satisfies the goal (like finding the correct answer) does not automatically break the loop unless an explicit control flow statement (`break`, `return`) is used.
