          "conceptual_gap": "The Java execution model guarantees that local variables maintain their assigned value precisely until they are explicitly reassigned within their scope. Since the outer loop counter `i` starts at 1 and `n` is non-negative, `i` is guaranteed to be positive inside the loop. Assigning `y = i` guarantees `y` is also positive. The defensive check `if (y != 0)` is unnecessary and indicates a failure to rely on the predictable stability of local variables derived from controlled loop invariants.",

          "conceptual_gap": "The student performs unnecessary defensive coding. Since the outer loop variable `i` (representing the current row height) starts at 1 (`int i = 1;`) and the loop condition is `while (i <= n)` (where `n` is guaranteed non-negative via `if (n < 0) n = 0;`), the variable `i` can never be 0 inside the inner loop structure if `i <= n` is true and `n` is 0 or greater. The check `if (y != 0)` is semantically useless and suggests the student is wary of potential null or zero states that the established control flow structure already prevents.",
