          "inferred_category_name": "Incomplete Sequential Range Checking",
          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that when using a cascade of `if-else if` statements to check ranges, only the lower bound (`grade >= threshold`) needs to be explicitly checked in subsequent branches (B, C, D), because the failure of the prior, higher range check implies the grade is less than the prior upper bound (e.g., failing `grade >= 90` means the grade must be less than 90). The student fails to realize that the explicit upper bound check used in the first branch (`grade <= 100`) is necessary only for validation but in competition with the intended range structure, the subsequent branches need to respect the *implicit* upper bound created by the prior `else if` conditions.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The intended pattern for grade checking using `if-else if` is to check ranges sequentially from highest to lowest, relying on the `else if` structure to implicitly enforce the upper bound (e.g., if we are at `else if (grade >= 80)`, we already know `grade < 90`). The student correctly implements this implicit bounding for grades 80 and below. However, the initial condition `if (grade >= a && grade <= 100)` is asymmetrical; it requires an explicit upper bound check and defines the 'A' range correctly. The subsequent checks, while technically correct for lower bounds (`grade >= b`, `grade >= c`), are flawed because they do not reflect the common mistake of omitting the implicit boundary. In this specific case, the code *works* as intended because the implicit bounding mechanism handles the standard grade scale correctly. The divergence isn't in runtime error, but in redundancy/style for the first grade check, which suggests a possible incomplete understanding of how the `else if` structure fully handles grade scales from top down.",
          "error_manifestation": "No functional error in this specific implementation due to the nature of the sequential logic, but the first condition uses an unnecessary explicit upper bound (`grade <= 100`) alongside the sequential structure, unlike the rest of the code, which relies solely on the lower bound check, potentially indicating structural confusion regarding range definition in `if-else if` cascades.",
