For a grade of 85, all of the expressions (grade_input >= 80), (grade_input >= 70), and (grade_input >= 60) are true, so every corresponding if executes, printing B, C, and D. The student is implicitly relying on a mental model where earlier ifs somehow restrict or modify what later ifs see, rather than realizing that the same grade_input is tested freshly each time and that overlapping conditions must be made exclusive via else-if chains or explicit range checks (e.g., grade_input >= 80 && grade_input <= 89).",
