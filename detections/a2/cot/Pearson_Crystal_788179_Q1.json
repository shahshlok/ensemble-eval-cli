          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that complex conditional logic, which typically requires an `if` statement, can be fully replaced by multiple assignments using the ternary operator (`? :`) across subsequent lines, treating the resulting variable (`b`) as a boolean flag that controls a later assignment (`c`). The student intends to calculate `b` as 1 if `n` is even (a==0) and 0 otherwise, and then multiply `n` by `b` (line 11) to achieve a conditional assignment (if n is even, c=n; if n is odd, c=0).",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student is incorrectly using the ternary operator for decision making followed by mathematical masking (`n*b`) to simulate an `if-else` control flow structure. While this specific sequence of operations (`a=n%2; b=a==0?1:0; c=n*b;`) correctly captures the logical equivalent of `if (n % 2 == 0) { c = n; } else { c = 0; }`, this implementation style is overly complex and fragile, indicating a reluctance or lack of familiarity with standard Java `if` statements for filtering input based on conditions. The complexity introduced by using multiple temporary variables (`a`, `b`, `c`) to achieve a simple conditional summation is a hallmark of this type of conceptual confusion, though it technically produces the correct output in this particular problem.",
