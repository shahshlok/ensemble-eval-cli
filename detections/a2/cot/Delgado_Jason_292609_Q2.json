This has two consequences: (1) The first guess, read before the loop, is not counted at all. If the first guess is correct, the loop body never executes, n remains 0, and the program prints \"Correct! You took 0 guesses.\" despite the user having made one guess. (2) Even when the user needs multiple guesses, the final correct guess is also not counted, because the loop stops as soon as x == a; the increment occurs only on iterations where x != a.
