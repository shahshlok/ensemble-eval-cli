          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that the inner loop will automatically use and update its own counter variable `j` from 1 up to `i`, so writing `i++` in the inner loop header is either equivalent to `j++` or at least harmless. They are reasoning in terms of \"this is the inner loop, so its update part will advance the inner loop\u2019s iteration regardless of which variable name is written there,\" and they expect each row to print exactly `i` asterisks.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, the three parts of a `for` loop header \u2014 initialization, condition, and update \u2014 are just normal statements and expressions that the programmer must specify correctly. The `for` loop does not infer which variable should be updated; it simply executes the update expression literally on every iteration of that loop. In the code `for (int j = 1; j <= i; i++)`, the update expression `i++` changes the *outer* loop variable `i`, not `j`. The inner loop\u2019s condition `j <= i` is evaluated repeatedly while `j` stays at 1 and `i` keeps increasing, so the condition remains true for an extremely large number of iterations. This causes the inner loop to print `*` millions of times until `i` overflows from `Integer.MAX_VALUE` to a negative value, at which point `j <= i` becomes false and the loop finally exits. The outer loop then continues with `i` being a large negative number, so subsequent rows print no asterisks at all. The gap is that the student is thinking of each `for` loop as being automatically tied to its declared loop variable, whereas in reality the programmer must explicitly update the correct counter (`j++` for the inner loop), and changing the outer loop\u2019s variable inside the inner loop radically alters the control flow.",
