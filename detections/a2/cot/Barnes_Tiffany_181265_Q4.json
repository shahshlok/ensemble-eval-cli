The student correctly derived c = b - a + 1 when thinking of how many integers lie between a and b inclusive, but then misapplied this to the loop bound. If c is the number of rows (N), looping from i = 1 while i < c only performs N - 1 iterations (1 to N - 1). To get N iterations starting at 1, the condition must be i <= N (or equivalently i <= c when c == N), or the loop must start at 0 and run while i < N. The gap is between the mathematical idea of an inclusive range length (b - a + 1) and the programming reality that loop conditions are evaluated strictly as written (using < vs <=) and that the loop variable never automatically reaches the endpoint unless the condition allows it.",
