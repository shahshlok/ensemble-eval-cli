They also believe that specifying lower bounds only (>= 90, >= 80, >= 70, >= 60) is enough to represent disjoint ranges like 90\u2013100, 80\u201389, 70\u201379, 60\u201369 because they think later conditions won't be evaluated once an earlier one has matched.",

Control flow does not automatically stop checking later if statements when an earlier if condition is true. In this code, for a grade like 85, all conditions that are true will execute: numericGradeValue >= 80, >= 70, and >= 60 are all true, so the program prints B, then C, then D. The correct mental model is that:\n\n1. A plain if is an independent conditional block: the JVM evaluates its condition, and if it is true, executes its body, then continues to the next statement in sequence.\n2. To make conditions mutually exclusive, you must use an if / else if / else chain, or write non-overlapping boolean conditions (e.g., grade >= 80 && grade <= 89).\n3. Writing only lower bounds (>= 90, >= 80, etc.) creates overlapping ranges; without else-if, a value can satisfy multiple conditions and trigger multiple outputs.\n\nThe student\u2019s model incorrectly assumes an implicit else between successive if statements and therefore does not account for overlapping condition ranges.",
