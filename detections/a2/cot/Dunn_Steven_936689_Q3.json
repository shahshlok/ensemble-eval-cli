If the grade is invalid (e.g., negative or above 100), the default F grade should be assigned in designated `else` blocks corresponding to the validation checks.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The core conceptual gap is the belief in extreme nesting (`if (0 <= grade) { if (grade <= 100) { ... grading logic ... } else { F } } else { F }`). While the logic is technically correct and produces the desired output, it overly complicates the control flow. The student fails to recognize that combining high-level validation with the grading sequence using efficient `else if` structures (or eliminating the need for separate boundary checks altogether in a correct cascading structure) is far simpler and more idiomatic. In this specific code, the deep nesting structure obscures the standard linear flow typically used for exclusive ranges.",
