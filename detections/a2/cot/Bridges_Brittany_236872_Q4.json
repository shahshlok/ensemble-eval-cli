Because `star` is never changed, the condition `star <= row` remains true once `row` becomes at least 1, causing the inner loop to run indefinitely while repeatedly incrementing `row`.

In the inner loop, the header `for (int star = 1; star <= row; row++)` means: initialize `star` to 1, repeatedly check `star <= row`, execute the body, then execute `row++` each iteration. Because `star` is never incremented, it stays 1 forever, while `row` keeps increasing, so the condition `star <= row` (1 <= growing row) never becomes false. This causes an infinite loop and also mutates the outer loop\u2019s control variable unexpectedly. The correct mental model is that the increment part of the for-loop must advance the variable that appears in the condition (`star` in this case), and updating the outer loop variable (`row`) inside the inner loop changes the outer loop\u2019s behavior and does not advance the inner loop counter.",
