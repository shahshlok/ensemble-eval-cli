Alternatively, they believe that the `if/else if` structure automatically prevents output when `guess == answer`.",

However, they do not seem to understand that the `while` loop condition at line 14 determines *only* whether the loop body executes *another* iteration. The loop body (lines 15-23), including the input reading (line 16) and the comparison/feedback (lines 19-23), is executed entirely for the final, correct guess before the loop condition is re-checked and found false.",

You took N guesses,' but it will also *correctly* not print any unnecessary feedback like 'Too low!' or 'Too high!' because the `if/else if` on lines 19 and 21 guards against generating feedback when the numbers are equal.",
