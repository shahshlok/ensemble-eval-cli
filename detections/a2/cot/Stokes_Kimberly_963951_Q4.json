They may also believe that changing row inside the inner loop either does not affect the outer loop, or somehow still leads to the inner loop finishing correctly.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, a for-loop only terminates when its condition becomes false, and this depends entirely on how the variables in the condition are updated. In the inner loop, the condition is star <= row, but star is never changed, while row is increased each iteration. This makes the condition remain true forever (1 <= 1, then 1 <= 2, 1 <= 3, ...), causing an infinite loop of '*' output. The student is not correctly reasoning that (1) the update expression must move the loop state toward falsifying the condition, and (2) incrementing row in the inner loop affects the same row variable used by the outer loop and the condition, not a separate or local copy.",

Because `row` keeps increasing, the condition `star <= row` remains true indefinitely, so the inner loop never terminates (until integer overflow), and it also corrupts the outer loop\u2019s control variable since `row` is the same variable in both loops. The student\u2019s mental model misses that the update must change the variable appearing in the condition in a way that can eventually make the condition false, and that `row` in the inner loop is not a new variable but the same one controlling the outer loop.",
