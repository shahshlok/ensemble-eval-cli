          "conceptual_gap": "The actual Java execution model requires only the remainder check (`a % 2`) to determine parity. The student incorrectly introduced an unnecessary variable (`c`) and calculation (`c = a - b;`), demonstrating a failure to isolate minimal necessary computational steps required by the control flow. Additionally, variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are initialized outside the loop only to be immediately overwritten inside, showing a misunderstanding of efficient variable declaration proximity/necessity.",
