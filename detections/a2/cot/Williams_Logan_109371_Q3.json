They also believe that writing conditions like grade >= 80 is enough to mean '80\u201389' because they rely on the earlier if (grade >= 90) to exclude 90\u2013100 implicitly.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, each if statement is evaluated independently unless it is explicitly chained with else or else if. The actual execution model is: for each if, the condition is evaluated; if it is true, the body runs, then control continues to the next statement. There is no automatic mutual exclusion between separate if statements.\n\nBecause of this, for grade = 85, the program:\n- Skips if (grade >= 90)\n- Executes if (grade >= 80) and prints \"Letter grade: B\"\n- Then still evaluates if (grade >= 70) (true) and prints \"Letter grade: C\"\n- Then evaluates if (grade >= 60) (true) and prints \"Letter grade: D\"\n\nSo the output becomes multiple letter grades instead of a single correct one. To match the intended grading ranges, the student either needs an if/else-if/else chain or mutually exclusive conditions (e.g., grade >= 80 && grade <= 89). Their mental model incorrectly treats sequential ifs as if they formed a mutually exclusive chain and assumes earlier true conditions prevent later ifs from executing, which is not how Java control flow works.",
