          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that after reading an input value (`value`), it must be copied immediately into a temporary variable (`temp`) before being used for subsequent calculations and conditional checks. This suggests the student may unnecessarily compartmentalize operations or perceive the original variable as transient, even though its scope is local and stable.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, a basic local variable like `value` retains its state and identity perfectly well until explicitly overwritten. The creation of `temp` is entirely redundant, as `value` could have been used directly in the conditional check and the summation operation without changing the program's logic or readability.",
