          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that complex relational checks (greater than, less than, equal to) must first be resolved into a standardized numerical 'indicator' or flag (like 1, -1, or 0) derived from calculating the difference between the variables. They think this numerical flag is necessary to reliably control the main flow of execution using an `if/else if` structure, rather than using direct boolean comparisons on the primary variables.",
          "conceptual_gap": "Java handles relational operators (`>`, `<`, `==`) directly, evaluating them to a boolean result which controls the `if` flow. Introducing intermediate variables like `differenceBetweenGuessAndAnswer` and `comparisonIndicator` to manually encode the comparison result is superfluous. The student is imposing a low-level, procedural comparison model (relying on sign interpretation) onto high-level Java control structures, indicating a misunderstanding of flow control expressiveness in the Java machine model.",

If the body of the loop executes, all code inside that iteration (lines 28-54) will run to completion, even if the terminating condition (the correct guess) is met and processed mid-iteration (lines 35-37).
