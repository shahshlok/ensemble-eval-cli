          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that each range check within an 'if-else if' sequence must explicitly include both the lower bound and the upper bound (e.g., `grade >= 80 && grade <= 89`) to correctly define the grade bracket. They feel the need to fully specify the bounds for the B, C, and D ranges, forgetting that the structural failure of the preceding, higher-grade conditions already implicitly enforces the required upper limit.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The execution model of Java's `else if` guarantees mutual exclusion. When control flow reaches an `else if` statement, it is guaranteed that all preceding `if` or `else if` conditions (which check for higher grades) failed. For example, by the time the code reaches the check for B, the program already knows the grade must be less than 90 (since the check for A: `grade >= 90` failed). Thus, explicitly checking for `<= 89` is redundant and demonstrates a failure to leverage the sequential nature of the control flow structure.",

They do not utilize the implicit upper bound established by the preceding failed `if` or `else if` statement.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In an `if-else if` ladder used for partitioning a numeric range (like 0-100), once a condition fails, the subsequent `else if` block only needs to check the new lower bound. For example, if `grade >= 90` fails, the program already knows `grade < 90`. The student unnecessarily adds the upper bound check (e.g., `grade <= 89` on line 20) inside a block that logically guarantees `grade < 90`. While this structure works correctly for grades 60-100, it is inefficient and demonstrates a lack of understanding of the flow control mechanism of the sequential `if-else if` structure.",
