Because userGuessNumber is never changed inside the loop, the condition userGuessNumber != secretAnswerNumber never changes, so if the first guess is wrong the loop becomes infinite and prints the same 'Too low!' or 'Too high!' message forever. Similarly, totalNumberOfGuesses is only incremented once before the loop and is never updated per iteration, because the student assumes the loop machinery is tracking guesses implicitly.
