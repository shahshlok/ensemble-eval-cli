          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that when a process must be repeated a fixed number of times (e.g., handling 5 inputs), the code for reading the input and applying the conditional logic must be manually and explicitly written out for each instance, requiring separate unique variables for storage. The student does not conceptualize the possibility of using a loop to reuse a single block of code and a single temporary variable for all inputs.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The Java execution model supports structured repetition using iteration (loops). The student is modeling the task as a sequence of unique discrete steps (hard-coding), rather than recognizing the core repetitive pattern. This demonstrates a failure to understand how control structures automate redundancy and abstract process flow.",
          "error_manifestation": "Code redundancy, poor code maintainability, and severe lack of scalability (if the required number of inputs N increased significantly). The final output is correct for the specific N=5 input constraint.",

          "conceptual_gap": "The student understands variables as mere storage locations but misses the concept of variable reuse and procedural abstraction afforded by control flow structures like `for` or `while` loops. This lack of understanding leads to redundant, verbose, and inflexible code, indicating a missing mental model component for iteration.",
