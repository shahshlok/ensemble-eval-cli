          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that variables containing the input values (`a, b, c, d, e`) must be copied into new variables (`n1, n2, n3, n4, n5`) before being used in conditional logic or calculations. This suggests a fear that the original variables might be overwritten, consumed, or altered by the operations (like the modulo check or addition to `sumEven`).",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, standard mathematical and comparison operations (like `%` or `==`) on primitive types operate purely on the variable's value and do not cause side effects or modifications to the variable itself. Assignment statements like `int n1 = a;` are entirely redundant since `a` could have been safely used wherever `n1` is now used.",
