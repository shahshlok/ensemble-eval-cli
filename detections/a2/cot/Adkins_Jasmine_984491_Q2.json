          "conceptual_gap": "In Java (and most imperative languages), the `while` loop's condition is evaluated *only* at the start of each iteration. The loop body executes fully, including outputting the 'Correct!' message (lines 26-27). This output does not stop the loop. Upon reaching line 16 again, the condition `guess != answer` is re-evaluated. Since the guess now equals the answer, the loop correctly terminates. However, placing the success message inside separate conditional blocks that do not modify the loop structure (like using a `break`) leads to unnecessary comparison checks and structural redundancy.",
          "error_manifestation": "The code runs correctly and terminates as intended, but the control flow logic is inefficient and slightly redundant. The successful guess is processed and the success message is printed, but the loop relies purely on the while condition check at the next iteration, not on the `else` block execution.",

          "conceptual_gap": "While initialization is syntactically required, structuring the code so the first input read happens *before* the loop starts, or restructuring the loop using a Do-While construct, would eliminate the need for an arbitrary initialization value that is immediately overwritten. The student's choice of `while (guess != answer)` forces an arbitrary initialization (0) just to enter the loop, betraying a difficulty in selecting the most appropriate loop structure (do-while) or initializing variables based on external constraints (e.g., using `do-while` or priming the loop).",
