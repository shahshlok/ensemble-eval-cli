          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that printing the final success message ('Correct! You took X guesses.') is always necessary inside the loop body, regardless of whether the loop terminates immediately after that statement. They rely on the `while` condition check happening just *after* the `System.out.println` statement, even when the guess is correct.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student has correctly implemented the conditional logic to check if the guess is correct (`else { ... }`). However, when the guess *is* correct, the code prints the success message and then immediately re-evaluates the `while` condition (`userGuessValue != secretAnswerNumber`). If the condition is false, the loop correctly terminates. The misconception lies in placing the success output *inside* the loop. In standard programming practice for games like this, the 'correct' branch inside the loop should handle the successful guess (including output) AND be immediately followed by a way to break or exit the loop construct *before* performing subsequent setup/prompt operations, or, ideally, the success output is placed immediately after the loop, signifying loop completion.",
          "error_manifestation": "No functional error in this specific implementation, but poor programming practice. The control flow logic is redundant, as the success output is only printed on the final successful iteration before the loop naturally terminates. This often suggests a lack of understanding regarding when to break out of a loop versus letting the loop condition organically handle termination.",
