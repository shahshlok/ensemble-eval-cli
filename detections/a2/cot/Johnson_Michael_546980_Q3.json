          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that when using nested 'if-else' statements to categorize ranges sequentially (e.g., checking 90s, then checking 80s), they must explicitly define both the minimum and maximum boundaries for the current range. They do not trust that entering an 'else' block implicitly guarantees failure of the preceding high-end conditions (e.g., if we are in the 'else' of '>= 90', the grade must be < 90).",
          "conceptual_gap": "Java's control flow using the 'else' construct naturally enforces mutual exclusion and sequential constraints. If execution reaches an inner 'if' statement inside an 'else' branch, it is guaranteed that the condition for the outer 'if' failed, thereby establishing an upper boundary for the current check. Explicitly checking the upper limit (e.g., `&& grade <= 89` at line 17) is redundant because the preceding failed check (`grade >= 90`) already enforces `grade < 90`. This technique demonstrates a failure to leverage the structural constraint provided by sequential conditional logic.",
