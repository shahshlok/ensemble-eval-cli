          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, assignment is destructive: `sum = b;` immediately overwrites whatever value `sum` previously held with the current value of `b`. Because `b` is a new local variable initialized to 0 on every iteration of the loop, `sum = b;` resets the total to 0 each time an even number is encountered. As a result, `sum += c;` only adds the current even number to 0, so after the loop `sum` contains only the last even input, not the sum of all even inputs. The correct model is: a running total must be updated from its own previous value (e.g., `sum += n;` or `sum = sum + n;`), and any assignment to `sum` with another variable's value completely replaces the old content of `sum`.",

At runtime, for each even number, this sequence means: (1) b becomes 0, (2) c becomes the current input n, (3) sum is set to 0 (losing any prior sum from previous iterations), and then (4) c is added to this 0, so sum becomes just the current even number.
