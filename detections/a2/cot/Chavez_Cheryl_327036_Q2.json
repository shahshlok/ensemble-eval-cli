          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, standard control flow dictates that all statements within the current iteration of a loop are executed sequentially, regardless of whether conditions are met that would cause the loop test to fail in the *next* iteration. When the correct guess is made, the final `else` block executes, printing the success message. The loop then continues to the closing brace, and *only then* does it check the `while` condition (`userGuess != answer`) before deciding whether to run another iteration. The student's use of the `while` structure requires the success message block to execute, but then relies on the loop condition for termination without implementing an explicit `break` or `return` to stop subsequent messages.",

When the user guesses correctly, the program prints the success message, but then immediately prints either 'Too low!' or 'Too high!' if the correct guess also happened to match the boundary conditions of the comparison checks which were erroneously left in the successful branch.",

          "conceptual_gap": "The student placed the comparison checks (`userGuess < answer` and `userGuess > answer`) incorrectly inside the successful outcome block (Line 22, the `else` block that means `userGuess == answer`). In actual Java execution, since the code inside the `else` block is only reached when `userGuess == answer`, the comparisons `userGuess < answer` and `userGuess > answer` inside that block can never be true. However, the logical error is that the student unnecessarily repeated the comparison structure inside the only place where the comparisons are redundant, leading to code that executes the success branch *always* followed by one of the redundant comparisons when the guess is correct.",
