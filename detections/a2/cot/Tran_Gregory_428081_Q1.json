They appear to think that this pattern somehow maintains or reflects the total sum of all even numbers seen so far, rather than realizing it only represents the current iteration's contribution.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, a variable declared inside a loop body (such as currentEvenNumberSum) is recreated and reinitialized on every iteration. Setting currentEvenNumberSum = 0 inside the loop means it always starts from 0 for each even number, so currentEvenNumberSum = currentEvenNumberSum + userInputValue; ends up just equaling the current even number, not a cumulative sum. Then the assignment sumOfEvenNumbers = currentEvenNumberSum; overwrites the previous total with this single value, discarding any contribution from earlier even numbers. The correct accumulator pattern is to keep a single variable (sumOfEvenNumbers) that is initialized once before the loop and updated cumulatively inside the loop (e.g., sumOfEvenNumbers = sumOfEvenNumbers + userInputValue; or sumOfEvenNumbers += userInputValue;). The student's code reflects a mental model where a per-iteration temporary sum plus an overwrite of the main sum is somehow equivalent to continuously adding into the same accumulator.",
