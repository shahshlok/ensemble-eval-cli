          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that each grade tier's logical condition must explicitly enforce both the lower and upper bounds (e.g., `grade >= 80 && grade <= 89`) to prevent lower tiers from inadvertently executing on inputs that fall into higher, previously checked tiers. They do not trust the cascading `else if` structure to handle the upper bound exclusion implicitly.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The `if-else if` control structure inherently provides exclusivity. If the grade is, for instance, `>= 90`, the 'A' block executes, and all subsequent `else if` branches are skipped. Therefore, when checking for a 'B' grade, which occurs in an `else if` branch following 'A', the programmer only needs to check for the lower bound (`grade >= 80`), as the condition `grade < 90` is guaranteed by the control flow.",
          "error_manifestation": "The code is functionally correct but is verbose and less efficient than necessary. It suggests a lack of understanding of control flow optimization.",
