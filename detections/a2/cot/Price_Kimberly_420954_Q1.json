They rotate through multiple distinct temporary variables (`a`, `b`, `c`) to ensure separation between sequential checks, fearing that immediate reuse would cause unintended side effects or interfere with the previous check's conditional logic.",
          "conceptual_gap": "Variable assignment in Java is a destructive update. Once the conditional block relying on a temporary variable (like `a = n1 % 2; if (a == 0) { ... }`) is fully executed, the variable is free to be immediately overwritten for the next independent calculation (`a = n2 % 2;`) without affecting the previous execution path or requiring intermediate variables like `b` or `c`. The student's model suggests a persistent, non-overwritable state for intermediate variables.",

          "conceptual_gap": "The student fails to grasp the concept of variable scope and reuse efficiency. The modulus operation `n % 2` is transient and its result is only needed immediately for the conditional check. The result can be stored in a single temporary variable (or computed inline) and immediately overwritten/reused for the next input, or the condition can be written directly as `if (n1 % 2 == 0)`. Instead, the student introduces unnecessary variables (`a`, `b`, `c`) and then inefficiently reuses only a subset of them (`a` for n1 and n4; `b` for n2 and n5; `c` for n3) in a pattern that suggests they initially thought they needed at least three distinct temporary holders.",
