          "inferred_category_name": "Feedback Output Logic Error on Correct Guess",
          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that if the guess (y) is not less than the answer (x) AND not greater than the answer (x), the loop will terminate, and therefore no feedback message will be printed inside the loop for a correct guess. The final feedback ('Correct!...') is sufficient.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student correctly uses an `if-else if` block to handle `y < x` and `y > x`. However, they fail to consider the exact case `y == x` within the loop body. When `y == x`, neither the `if` (Line 13) nor the `else if` (Line 14) condition is met, so nothing is printed. The loop correctly breaks on the *next* iteration check (Line 9). The conceptual gap is not about Java execution, but a flaw in logical structure: when the correct number is guessed, the standard 'Too low'/'Too high' branch structure must ensure that *only* the correct feedback is given. If the guess is correct, the logic performs all necessary actions (incrementing `n`) but intentionally prints nothing for the correct guess inside the loop, relying solely on the loop termination mechanism and the final print statement outside the loop. This is technically correct programming logic based on the constraints (only outputting 'Too high' or 'Too low' for *wrong* guesses), but it results in a behavior where the user sees a prompt/guess, then nothing, then the final result, which might feel slightly incomplete compared to standard guessing game implementations where the 'Correct!' confirmation appears immediately after the successful input read. However, based strictly on the requirement to *only* tell the user whether their guess was 'Too high' or 'Too low' *after each wrong guess*, the student\u2019s code is actually correct and efficient, avoiding redundant checks and output. Since the code handles all requirements exactly as specified and produces the correct final output, I must conclude there is no Notional Misconception leading to an operational error.",
          "error_manifestation": "None. The code functions correctly according to the problem requirements and sample output. If the secret number is 62 and the user guesses 62, the output is seamless: 'Guess a number (1-100): 62' -> 'Correct! You took N guesses.'",
