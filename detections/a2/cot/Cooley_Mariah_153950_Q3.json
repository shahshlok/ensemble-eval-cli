If execution proceeds through a cascaded if-else if structure without matching any condition (A, B, C, D), the variable retains its initialized value. The explicit reassignment of 'F' within the final `else` block (L40) is therefore redundant and demonstrates a lack of trust in the persistence of initialized state through skipped conditional paths.",

The final `else` clause inherently handles all remaining values below 60 (since all higher ranges are explicitly checked), making the initial explicit `if (safe_grade >= 0)` condition before the grading logic redundant given the prior clamping (lines 13-20). Furthermore, explicitly setting `letterGrade = 'F'` in the final `else` block (L35-L36) is also redundant, as 'F' was already set as the default initializer (L22).",
