          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, control flow structures like `while` loops execute until the termination condition is met. Setting variables or printing output inside the loop body (like printing 'Correct!') does not halt the iteration immediately unless an explicit control flow statement (like `break`) is used. Although the loop terminates successfully on the *next* iteration check because `userGuess` is now equal to `c`, placing the success conditional logic inside the loop body without a `break` is logically redundant. Furthermore, if the conditional check for `diff == 0` had been placed *before* the input operation, the program would loop indefinitely or behave incorrectly.",
          "error_manifestation": "Logical redundancy and inefficient execution. If the guess is correct, the program prints the success message and then still executes the remainder of the conditional ladder (`else if (diff > 0)` and `else`), although in this specific structure, the successful guess (`diff == 0`) prevents the other branches from executing. The loop then correctly terminates on the next iteration check.",
