This suggests confusion about which variables are actually required for the algorithm. The loop only needs N to iterate correctly; the intermediate calculation of 'c' serves no purpose. This indicates the student may not fully understand the independence of different parts of their code or holds onto unnecessary computational steps from an earlier mental model.",
