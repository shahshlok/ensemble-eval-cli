In their mental model, once a grade has been classified and printed (e.g., as 'A'), later if statements for 'B', 'C', and 'D' are implicitly skipped, so they do not need to include explicit upper bounds (like grade <= 89) or use else-if. They expect one and only one letter grade to be printed.",

The conditions in this program are overlapping: for example, an 85 satisfies >= 80, >= 70, and >= 60, so all three bodies execute, producing three lines of output (B, then C, then D). The computer does not know that these conditions are meant to be mutually exclusive ranges; it simply checks each condition in the written order, and any true condition runs its block. To encode non-overlapping ranges, the student must either (1) use an if / else-if / else chain so that only the first true condition executes, or (2) give each if a mutually exclusive range (e.g., grade >= 80 && grade <= 89). Because this conceptual link between overlapping predicates and control flow is missing, the program prints multiple, conflicting letter grades and the last one printed overwrites the previous logical classification in the student's intended sense. This also breaks their stated intention in the else branch: they comment that out-of-range values should still get an F, but for a value like 150, all of the >= 90/80/70/60 checks are true and the program prints A, B, C, and D instead of a single F.",

This is redundant and violates the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle. In Java, if the logic is the same regardless of whether the value is in range or not, it should be written once, not duplicated. The outer validation check is unnecessary given the problem constraints and adds no real safety value that would justify this code duplication.",
