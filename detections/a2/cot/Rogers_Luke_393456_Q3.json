          "inferred_category_name": "Unnecessary Defensive Variable Copying",
          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that variables used for comparison or temporary storage within a conditional block must be distinct copies (e.g., `tempGrade` and `tempLetter`) of the input variable (`grade`) and the final output variable (`letterGrade`). This suggests a fear that direct use of the main variables might lead to unintentional mutation or corruption of their original state, or a misunderstanding of variable scope and assignment.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, primitive variables (`int`) and non-mutating variables like `String` literals/references, when used in comparisons or simple value assignments within local scope, do not automatically change the value of the source variable. The introduction of `tempGrade` (a direct copy of `grade` which is never altered) and `tempLetter` (a string used only as an intermediate storage before being immediately assigned to `letterGrade`) demonstrates a lack of confidence in the isolation properties of local variable assignments, leading to redundant memory allocation and overly complex code structure.",
