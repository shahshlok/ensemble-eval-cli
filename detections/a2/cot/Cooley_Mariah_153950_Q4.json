          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, a boolean expression in an `if` is evaluated using formal logic rules: `A || B` is true if *either* A or B is true. For any integer `safeN`, exactly one of `safeN != 0` or `safeN == 0` is always true, so `safeN != 0 || safeN == 0` is a tautology that always evaluates to `true`. Thus the `if` statement does not actually guard the loop; the body will always execute as if it were not inside an `if` at all. The student appears to treat the two comparisons as separate \u201ccases\u201d that must be listed, rather than understanding that the combined expression is just a single boolean value that can simplify to `true` regardless of input.",

Here, the loop condition `while (col <= row)` already prevents execution when `col` is not in the desired range. Because `col` is initialized to 1, `if (col != 0)` is always true and has no effect on the program\u2019s control flow.
