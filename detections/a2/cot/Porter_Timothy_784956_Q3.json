For grades below 60, the `else if (grade >= 60)` condition is false, so the nested `if/else` block is skipped entirely and no branch runs, resulting in no output. The correct model is: conditions in an if-else-if chain are tested in order, and if none match, execution simply continues after the chain; nothing is executed unless there is an explicit final `else`.
