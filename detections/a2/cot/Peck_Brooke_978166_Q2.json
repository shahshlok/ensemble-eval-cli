          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, Scanner.next() never returns null. It either returns a non-null String token that was read from the input, or it throws a NoSuchElementException if there is no more input. The null check therefore reflects a mistaken model where 'no data' or 'bad data' is represented as null rather than by exceptions or by the hasNext*() methods. This indicates confusion between Java's use of null as a normal value and its separate mechanism (exceptions and hasNext* checks) for signaling absence of input.",
          "error_manifestation": "No visible error for normal interactive use; the null check is redundant and may give a false sense of safety. At end-of-file, the program would still throw NoSuchElementException instead of getting a null value.",

In the context of interactive input following a failed `hasNextInt()`, the token read on line 35 is guaranteed to be a non-null String representing the input token. The conditional check on line 36 is logically redundant and indicates an incorrect assumption about the return guarantees of `scanner.next()` when a token is available.",
