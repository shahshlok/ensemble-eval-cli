          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that every numeric range in an if-else if structure must be explicitly defined using both a lower bound (>=) and an upper bound (<=) to ensure the grade falls exactly within that scope, regardless of the sequential nature of the checks.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student does not leverage the implicit boundaries established by preceding failed conditions in a descending, sequential if-else if structure. Since the checks are ordered from highest grade (A: >= 90) down, reaching the subsequent 'else if' branch (e.g., 'B': 80-89) inherently guarantees the numeric grade is already less than the preceding range's lower bound (i.e., less than 90). Therefore, the upper bound checks (e.g., `numericGradeValue <= upperBoundB`) are structurally and computationally redundant, as they repeat checks implicitly performed by the `if-else if` sequence.",
          "error_manifestation": "Functionally correct logic leading to correct output, but implemented using excessively verbose and complex conditional statements (including the declaration of 10 boundary variables) where simpler checks would suffice.",
