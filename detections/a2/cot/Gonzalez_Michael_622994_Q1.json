          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, the loop condition in `for (init; condition; update)` is checked before each iteration, and the body executes only while the condition is true. With `for (int i = 1; i < 5; i++)`, the values of i that satisfy `i < 5` are 1, 2, 3, and 4; when i becomes 5, the condition `5 < 5` is false, so the loop stops and the body does not run for i = 5. Thus, the program reads only 4 integers instead of 5. This mismatch between the printed prompt ('Enter 5 integers') and the actual number of iterations leads to an incorrect sum (e.g., with input `3 8 2 7 4`, the code sums only 8 and 2 to get 10, ignoring the last even number 4). The gap is a misunderstanding that the upper bound in a strict `<` loop condition is exclusive, not inclusive.",
