They do not fully rely on the guarantee that failing the preceding, higher condition implicitly enforces the necessary upper boundary for the current check.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student does not leverage the cascading exclusion property of the `if-else if` control flow. If execution reaches an `else if` block, all previous conditions are guaranteed to be false. Consequently, the explicit upper bound checks (`&& grade <= X`) are redundant because the failure of the immediately preceding condition already established that the grade is less than the next higher threshold. This use of verbose logic indicates a conceptual gap regarding control flow efficiency and semantic understanding of nested conditional structuring.",
