          "student_thought_process": "The student believes it is either mandatory or harmless to declare and potentially initialize multiple variables ('i', 'j', 'c') in the declaration statement alongside the actual inputs and loop counters ('n', 'a', 'b'), regardless of whether those variables are ever accessed or used later in the program logic.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, variables should be declared only when they are needed for a specific purpose. The student has declared and initialized `i` and `j`, and declared `c`, none of which are used in the subsequent control flow structure. This indicates a misunderstanding of variable necessity and scope/local management, potentially treating variable declaration as monolithic boilerplate setup rather than an execution step tied to computation.",
