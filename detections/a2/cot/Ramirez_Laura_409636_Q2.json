In this code, `guess` is read once before entering the loop and is never updated inside the loop body. As a result, the loop condition `guess != answer` is evaluated over and over with an unchanged `guess`, so if the first guess is wrong the loop becomes infinite. The student\u2019s mental model treats the `while` as a high-level \"keep asking until correct\" construct that automatically re-prompts the user and updates `guess`, instead of understanding that the programmer must explicitly place `guess = scan.nextInt();` (and the prompt) inside the loop so that `guess` changes between iterations.",
