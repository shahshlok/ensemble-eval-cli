They seem to think that the `for` header somehow keeps its own notion of the current iteration separate from the variable `a`, or that manually setting `a = 0` only affects how the next line will look, without breaking the overall iteration logic.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, the variable named in a `for` loop header *is* the loop\u2019s control state. Every iteration of the loop re-evaluates the condition (`a <= userInputHeight`) and then executes the increment expression (`a++`) using the *current* value of `a`. If you assign to `a` inside the loop body, you are directly changing what the loop condition and increment will see next. In this code, setting `a = 0` inside the inner loop both (1) immediately reduces the limit used by `b <= a`, so only one `*` is printed per row, and (2) causes the outer loop\u2019s increment to run from `a = 0` to `a = 1` every time. That combination makes `a` stay at 1 at the start of each outer iteration, so the condition `a <= userInputHeight` is always true (for positive heights) and the loop never terminates. The student\u2019s mental model misses that the loop header does not have a separate, immutable copy of the counter; the variable `a` is single, mutable state shared between the header and the body.",
