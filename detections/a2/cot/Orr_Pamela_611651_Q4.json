          "conceptual_gap": "The student fails to recognize that variables defined and controlled solely within tightly structured loops maintain predictable state transitions. Since 'row' is initialized to 1 (L15) and only ever increments while N is positive (L14), 'limit' (L18), which equals 'row', is guaranteed to be positive. The check `if (limit >= 0)` (L19) is completely redundant and demonstrates an over-defensiveness or lack of confidence in the program's own determinism.",
