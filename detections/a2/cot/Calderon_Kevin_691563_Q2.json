          "conceptual_gap": "The Java `while` loop checks its condition *only* at the beginning of each iteration. When the correct guess is made inside the loop body, the success message is printed (lines 25-26), but the loop continues until the condition is re-evaluated at the end of the iteration (line 28) and found to be false (line 14). The student correctly handles the *logic* of the game, but places the success output *inside* the loop's control structure rather than *after* the loop terminates, which leads to redundant output when the user guesses correctly, provided the loop's only exit condition is the guess being correct itself.",
          "error_manifestation": "Wrong output sequence/Redundant output. When the user successfully guesses the number, the success message is printed inside the loop, but the loop variable `userGuess` now equals `answer`, causing the loop to terminate immediately after the message is printed, thus manifesting as correct functional behavior in typical single-run testing. However, structurally, the final `else` block is only necessary if the loop body is designed to handle *only* incorrect guesses, exiting immediately upon correctness.",
