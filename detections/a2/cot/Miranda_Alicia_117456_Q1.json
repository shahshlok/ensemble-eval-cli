          "inferred_category_name": "Redundant Intermediate Variables in Self-Assignment",
          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that when updating a variable based on its own existing value (like incrementing a counter or accumulating a sum), the result of the calculation must first be stored in a *newly declared* temporary variable (`newSum`, `newCount`) before being assigned back to the original variable (`sum`, `count`). They may fear that calculating `sum + current` and immediately assigning it to `sum` in a single statement (`sum = sum + current;` or `sum += current;`) would lead to an error or use an outdated value of `sum` in the calculation.",
          "conceptual_gap": "Java guarantees that the computation on the right-hand side of an assignment always completes before the assignment operator performs its final update to the left-hand variable (or memory location). Self-assignment expressions (like `sum = sum + current;` or using compound assignments like `sum += current;` and `count++;`) are standard, efficient, and fully supported. The student's approach introduces unnecessary variable declarations and assignments, demonstrating a distrust in the basic mechanics of how computation and assignment are sequenced.",
          "error_manifestation": "Functional code, but overly verbose and repetitive structure, using two lines and two variable names where one line (`sum += current;` and `count++;`) would suffice.",
