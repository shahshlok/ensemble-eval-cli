          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, the for-loop condition (`i < 5`) is checked before each iteration, and the loop continues only while the condition is true. With `int i = 1; i < 5; i++`, the values of `i` will be 1, 2, 3, and 4; when `i` becomes 5, the condition `i < 5` is false and the loop stops. Thus the body runs only 4 times and only 4 integers are read. To execute the body 5 times starting from 1, the correct condition would be `i <= 5`; alternatively, starting from 0 with `i < 5` also gives 5 iterations. The student is treating the upper bound in the loop condition as if it were inclusive rather than exclusive.",
