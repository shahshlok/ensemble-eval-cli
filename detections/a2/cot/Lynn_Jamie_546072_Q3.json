In other words, they seem to think that the inner `else` is a general fallback for all grades that failed any of the previous conditions in the whole chain, not just for the `if (n >= 65)` test.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, each `if`/`else if`/`else` belongs to a very specific syntactic structure. The `else` at line 16 is paired only with the immediately preceding `if (n >= 65)` at line 14, not with the entire chain beginning at `if (n >= 90)`. Because of this:\n\n- When `n` is between 60 and 64 (inclusive), the program reaches `else if (n >= 60)` (line 13), then fails `if (n >= 65)` (line 14), and so the inner `else` (line 16) executes and prints `F`, even though the specification says 60\u201369 should be `D`.\n- When `n` is below 60, the condition `n >= 60` at line 13 is false, so execution skips the whole block at lines 14\u201317. There is no final `else` for the outer chain, so no output is printed at all for grades below 60, even though the specification requires `F` for those values.\n\nThe gap is that the student does not fully grasp that:\n1. Conditions must be explicitly written to cover every numeric range needed (e.g., `< 60`), and\n2. An `else` only handles the \"otherwise\" case for its immediately preceding `if`, not for all earlier `if`/`else if` conditions in the chain.",
