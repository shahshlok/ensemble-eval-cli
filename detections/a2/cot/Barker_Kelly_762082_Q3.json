          "conceptual_gap": "In an `if-else if` cascade structure, conditions are evaluated sequentially. If the preceding `if` or `else if` condition failed (e.g., 90-100), the program is guaranteed that the variable `n` is less than 90 before evaluating the next condition. Therefore, checking the upper bound (`n <= 89`) is logically redundant given the structure. The student's model assumes independent conditional checks rather than leveraging the exclusionary nature of the `else` keyword.",

For instance, after failing `n >= 90`, the range of `n` is known to be `n < 90`. Therefore, the check for 'B' only needs to be `n >= 80`. Including the upper boundary constraint (`&& n <= 89`) is unnecessary since `n > 89` would have been caught by the previous `if` block (n >= 90).
