          "conceptual_gap": "The student has not generalized the task (read a number, check if even, add if so) into a reusable pattern. They fail to utilize control flow structures (like `for` or `while` loops) which are the essential mechanism in Java (and most languages) for handling repetitive tasks or processing an unknown or large quantity of items efficiently using minimal, reusable code.",

While the current approach works for exactly 5 inputs, a loop is the fundamental mechanism for concise repetition and scaling (e.g., if the requirement changed to 100 inputs).
