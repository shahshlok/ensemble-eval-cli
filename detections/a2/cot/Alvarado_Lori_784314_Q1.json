Additionally, `lastSum = sum;` replaces the previous value of `lastSum` rather than adding to it, so earlier even numbers are discarded when a later assignment occurs. To correctly accumulate a sum across iterations, the accumulator (e.g., `lastSum`) must be initialized once before the loop and then updated with `lastSum += value;` (or `lastSum += sum;`) inside the loop, without resetting it to 0.",
