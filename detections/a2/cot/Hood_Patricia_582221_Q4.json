          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that all numerical constants used to initialize loop ranges, even simple constants like 1 or the final limit N, must be explicitly assigned to separate, descriptive variables (`a`, `b`, `c`, `j_start`) and sometimes derived through formal arithmetic (`b - a + 1`), rather than being used directly as literals or simpler calculations. This suggests a rigid, over-generalized model for defining iteration bounds.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student fails to recognize that variables like `a`, `b`, `c`, and `j_start` are completely redundant because their values are fixed constants derived directly from the input `N` (specifically, `a=1`, `b=N`, `c=N`, `j_start=1`). The actual Java execution model correctly calculates these fixed values initialization time, but the introduction of these excessive variables complicates the code unnecessarily and reveals a procedural misunderstanding regarding when abstraction via variables is necessary versus when direct constants are clearer and more efficient.",

          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that assigning variables (like `a`, `b`, `c`, `row_count`, `j_start`, `j_end`) to static values or simple expressions makes the code clearer or somehow necessary, even when these variables are redundant or based directly on loop indices (`i`) or constants (`N`/1). Specifically, the student seems to be trying to mathematically define the iteration limits (`a`, `b`, `c`) of the outer loop (`i`) and then redefine the limits (`j_start`, `j_end`) of the inner loop based on the outer loop's index, rather than using the standard loop index variables directly. This suggests a hesitancy to rely solely on the control variables provided by the `for` statement.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The code uses many intermediate variables (`a`, `b`, `c`, `row_count`, `j_start`, `j_end`) whose values are either constants (1), equivalent to major parameters (`N`/`i`), or trivial calculations (`c = N - 1 + 1 = N`). In procedural programming, excessive intermediate variables that are equivalent to constants or already existing variables add clutter without improving logic, performance, or correctness (in this case, it doesn't break the logic, but it makes the code unnecessarily complex). The student misses the principle of directness and conciseness when controlling loops. For example, lines 18-20 are completely redundant because `row_count` is just `i` and the inner loop could run from `j=1` up to `i` directly.",
