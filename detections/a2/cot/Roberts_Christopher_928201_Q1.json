          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, a for-loop runs its body only while the loop condition is true at the start of each iteration. With 'for (int i = 1; i < 5; i++)', the values of i are 1, 2, 3, and 4. When i becomes 5, the condition 'i < 5' is false, so the loop stops before a fifth iteration. Thus, the body executes only 4 times, and only 4 integers are read from input, even though the prompt claims 5. To execute the body 5 times while starting at 1, the condition must be 'i <= 5'; or, using zero-based counting, start at 0 and use 'i < 5'. The student\u2019s mental model treats the upper bound as if it were inclusive, rather than understanding that the loop condition is evaluated as a strict boolean expression that must remain true.",
