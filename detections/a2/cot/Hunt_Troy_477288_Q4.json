Here, the inner loop condition is `j <= i`, but j is never updated, so the truth of that condition depends entirely on i. Because i is incremented inside the inner loop, and starts out greater than or equal to j, `j <= i` remains true forever, so the inner loop never terminates. The student is reasoning as if the inner loop were somehow implicitly counting iterations up to i, rather than understanding that the inner loop must explicitly modify the variable (j) that appears in its own condition. They also appear not to realize that modifying i inside the inner loop directly affects the outer loop\u2019s control variable, since both loops share the same i, rather than each loop having its own independent copy.",
