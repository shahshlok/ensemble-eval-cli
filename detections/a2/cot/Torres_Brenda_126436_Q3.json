          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that when using an `if-else if` structure to check sequential, non-overlapping ranges, each condition must explicitly check both the lower boundary and the upper boundary of the required range to ensure the grade is assigned correctly. They do not trust the `else if` mechanism to implicitly filter out values that satisfied previous, higher conditions.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The `else if` structure ensures mutual exclusivity. If the execution reaches the `else if (n >= 80 && n <= 89)` block, it is already guaranteed that the preceding condition (`n >= 90`) was false, meaning `n` is strictly less than 90 (or less than or equal to 89 for integers). Checking the upper bound (`n <= 89`) is therefore redundant. This indicates a limited understanding of how sequential control flow simplifies conditional logic by implicitly defining upper bounds.",
