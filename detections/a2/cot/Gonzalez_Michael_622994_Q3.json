          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that each conditional branch in an 'if-else if' ladder is an independent check that needs to define the entire range (both high and low boundaries) to prevent scores from falling into multiple categories. They fail to recognize that the sequential nature of 'else if' automatically enforces the required upper boundary because previous, higher-grade conditions have already failed.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student does not leverage the control flow structure inherent in an `if-else if` ladder. When code execution reaches an `else if` clause, it is implicitly guaranteed that all prior conditions were false. For example, reaching the check for the 'B' grade (>= 80) means the grade is already confirmed to be less than 90 (since the 'A' condition failed), thus making the explicit check for `<= 89` redundant.",
