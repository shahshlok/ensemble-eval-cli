Actions dependent on valid data (like counting a successful guess) must be executed conditionally *after* verification. Because the increment happens unconditionally on Line 26, before the range check (Line 28), the program incorrectly counts out-of-range inputs as valid guesses, even though they result in an error message.",

They treat loop termination and final state checking as separate concerns.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student fails to recognize that the `while` loop condition (`while (correct == false)`) is the primary guard for the execution of the code block within the loop. When `correct` is set to `true` inside the loop (L36), the loop terminates naturally.

          "conceptual_gap": "The student does not fully trust that `guessCount` retains its final accumulated value after the `while` loop terminates (L18).
