They might fear that the original state might change or be corrupted before the print statement executes sequentially.",

Since the assignment on Line 57 and the print statement on Line 60 happen one after the other in the same control flow block without any intervening modification, copying the value is redundant and suggests a distrust in the basic stability of variables during sequential execution.",
