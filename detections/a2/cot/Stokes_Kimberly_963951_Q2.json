          "conceptual_gap": "The student implemented the core game logic flawlessly. The only potential execution quirk is that when a guess is successful (`guess == answer`), the code inside the loop that checks for 'Too low' or 'Too high' is correctly skipped, but the loop needs to complete its current iteration to reach the condition check at the beginning of the *next* iteration. However, the student's code is correct because the success condition is handled by the natural flow of control: when `guess == answer`, the conditional blocks (`if/else if`) are skipped, the `while` loop condition fails for the next check, and execution proceeds to the summary output. There is no divergence or detectable misconception related to the notional machine execution model in this specific implementation.",
