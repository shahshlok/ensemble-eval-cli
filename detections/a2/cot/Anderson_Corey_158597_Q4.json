          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that starting a for-loop counter at 1 and using a '<' upper bound will still give them exactly the upper-bound number of iterations. Specifically, they think:\n- \"I want 'triangleHeight' rows, so I say currentRowNumber < triangleHeight\" will produce triangleHeight rows (1 through triangleHeight inclusive).\n- \"I want 'currentRowNumber' stars, so I say currentStarCount < currentRowNumber\" will produce exactly currentRowNumber stars.\nThey are reasoning as if the loop condition somehow counts how many times it has run, rather than acting as a strict comparison against the current counter value. They do not appear to be mentally combining the starting value with the strict '<' condition to see how many iterations will actually execute.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, a for-loop executes as long as the condition is true; the condition is evaluated on the current value of the loop variable, not on how many iterations have occurred.\n\nActual model for `for (int i = start; i < end; i++)`:\n- The loop variable `i` starts at `start`.\n- Before each iteration, Java checks `i < end`.\n- If true, the body runs; then `i` is incremented; then the condition is checked again.\n- The last value of `i` that runs the body is `end - 1`.\n- So the number of iterations is `end - start`.\n\nApplied to this code:\n- Outer loop: `for (int currentRowNumber = 1; currentRowNumber < triangleHeight; currentRowNumber++)`\n  - With `triangleHeight = 4`, `currentRowNumber` takes values 1, 2, 3. The body runs 3 times, not 4. To get rows 1, 2, 3, 4, the condition must be `currentRowNumber <= triangleHeight` (or start at 0 and go `< triangleHeight`).\n\n- Inner loop: `for (int currentStarCount = 1; currentStarCount < currentRowNumber; currentStarCount++)`\n  - For a given `currentRowNumber`, `currentStarCount` takes values 1, 2, ..., `currentRowNumber - 1`, so the number of stars printed is `currentRowNumber - 1`.\n  - Example: when `currentRowNumber = 3`, stars printed: for `currentStarCount = 1` and `2` only \u2192 2 stars, not 3.\n\nCombining both:\n- For input 4, the program prints 3 rows instead of 4.\n- The first row prints 0 stars (inner loop never runs when `currentRowNumber = 1`, because `1 < 1` is false).\n\nThe gap is that the student has not internalized the precise relationship between:\n- starting value of the loop counter,\n- strict `<` vs. non-strict `<=` comparisons,\n- and the resulting number of iterations and exact values taken by the loop variable. They are treating `<` as if it somehow guarantees an inclusive range up to the bound when starting from 1, which is not how Java loop semantics work.",
