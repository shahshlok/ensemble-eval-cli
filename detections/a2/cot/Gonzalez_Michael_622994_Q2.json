          "conceptual_gap": "The `while` loop condition is only evaluated *before* the loop body executes and *after* the loop body finishes a complete iteration. If `userGuess` is updated to equal `secretNumber` inside the loop (lines 16-25), the remaining statements of that specific iteration are executed sequentially, including the conditional logic and the associated 'Correct!' output, before the loop condition is re-evaluated and found to be false.",

When the final correct guess is made, the program prints the success message once due to the conditional block on lines 23-25, and then immediately repeats the success message because lines 23-25 are executed again on the final iteration before the loop terminates.",
