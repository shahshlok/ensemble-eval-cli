While not strictly an error, it suggests a lack of understanding or comfort with combining expressions directly within control structures.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student uses an unnecessary local variable (`remainderWhenDividedByTwo`) to store the result of `currentUserInputValue % 2`, which could have been used inline in the condition check, simplifying the code. Java allows complex expressions in conditional statements, and storing temporary, single-use results is often inefficient or indicative of a procedural rather than expression-based mental model.",

          "conceptual_gap": "Closing a `Scanner` linked to `System.in` closes the underlying input stream. While it is standard practice to close resources, closing `System.in` is generally discouraged in standard command-line applications unless the program is terminating immediately, as it prevents reuse by other parts of the application or system. The necessity of closing this specific resource type is often misunderstood by beginners.",
