          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that variables derived from input or critical loop controls must be copied into a 'temporary' variable ('for safety and clarity') before being used in critical control flow. This suggests a fear that the original variable might be linked to or modified by external factors (like the closing Scanner or loop context) if used directly.",
          "conceptual_gap": "Primitive types (like `int`) in Java are always passed and assigned by value. Once a value is read into `userInputHeight` (L12) or set for `currentRowNumber` (L23), it cannot be externally modified unless explicitly reassigned by the code. Creating copies (like `triangleHeight` on L18 and `numberOfStarsInCurrentRow` on L26) provides no additional safety, clarity, or isolation against unintended variable mutation. This demonstrates a misunderstanding of Java's variable isolation rules for primitives.",
