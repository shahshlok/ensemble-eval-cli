          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that in an `if-else if` structure, every conditional block must explicitly define both the upper and lower limits of its grade range (e.g., for B, checking both `>= 80` and `<= 89`). They do not incorporate the sequential nature of the `else if` cascade into their mental model, which should automatically exclude the upper limits established by previous conditions.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The Java execution model guarantees that if control flow reaches an `else if`, the preceding `if` condition (and all preceding `else if` conditions) must have failed. For example, when checking for grade B (L29), the program already knows the grade must be less than 90 because the 'A' condition (Grade >= 90) failed. Therefore, the explicit upper bound check (`&& userInputGrade <= 89`) is logically redundant. The student's model treats these conditions as independent interval checks rather than utilizing the control flow structure to simplify the logic.",
