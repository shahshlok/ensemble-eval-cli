The student does not leverage the implicit flow control where the failure of the preceding conditional already establishes the upper bound for the current check.",
          "conceptual_gap": "Java's `if-else if` construct ensures sequential, mutually exclusive evaluation. Since the conditions are checked in descending order (90, then 80, then 70...), if the check reaches `else if (grade >= 80)`, it is already guaranteed that `grade < 90` (because if it were 90 or above, the 'A' block would have executed and the chain would have terminated). Therefore, explicitly checking the upper limit (e.g., `&& grade <= 89`) is redundant and inefficient, indicating a conceptual gap in understanding flow control efficiency.",

Once `grade < X` is established by the failure of the prior block, checking the upper bound (`grade <= Y`) is redundant and unnecessary bureaucracy.
