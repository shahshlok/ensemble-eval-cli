In their mind, grades 90+, 80\u201389, 70\u201379, and 60\u201369 are caught by the preceding conditions, and any grade below 60 will fall into that final `else` and print \"Letter grade: F\". They also appear to think that putting `if (x >= 65)` directly after `else if (x >= 60)` is just a way to fine-tune the D range without affecting how the `else` works for values below 60.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, `else` is always paired with the closest preceding unmatched `if`, regardless of indentation or the programmer's intent. The nested `if (x >= 65)` on line 14 executes only when the outer `else if (x >= 60)` on line 13 is true. Consequently, the `else` on line 16 is attached to `if (x >= 65)`, not to the entire if/else-if chain. This means: (1) for x between 60 and 64, the outer condition `x >= 60` is true, the inner `x >= 65` is false, so the inner `else` runs and incorrectly prints F instead of D; (2) for x below 60, the outer `if` and all `else if` conditions are false, so the nested `if/else` block is never entered and nothing is printed at all. The student is missing the rule that a stand-alone `else` only covers the immediately preceding `if`, and that to provide a default case for all remaining values, it must be written as an `else` matching the outer if/else-if chain (or with braces to control grouping).",
