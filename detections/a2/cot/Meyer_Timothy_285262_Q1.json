          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, the `||` operator implements inclusive logical OR: the combined expression is true if either operand is true. Because any integer `y` must either be equal to 0 or not equal to 0, the expression `y != 0 || y == 0` is a tautology and will always evaluate to `true`. The student appears to lack a firm grasp of how boolean expressions are evaluated and may be reasoning in informal natural language rather than precise boolean logic. They may think that explicitly listing both cases with `||` is required to ensure the code runs or to 'check' something, instead of recognizing that an `if` with a condition that is always true is unnecessary and that code should just be executed directly without a conditional.",
