          "conceptual_gap": "The `else if` structure ensures that if a block is reached, all preceding conditions must have been false. Since the grade checks are evaluated in descending order (90s, then 80s, etc.), the upper bound check in subsequent conditions is logically guaranteed (e.g., if the code reaches the check for B, it is already guaranteed that the grade is < 90). Including the upper bound check (e.g., `temp_grade <= 89`) is redundant and demonstrates a failure to fully model the cascading nature of Java's flow control.",
