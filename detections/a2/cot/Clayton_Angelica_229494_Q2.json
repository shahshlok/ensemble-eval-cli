          "conceptual_gap": "In Java (and in structured control flow generally), once execution enters the 'else' branch of an 'if (guess == answer)' statement, it is guaranteed that 'guess != answer'. All further tests are constrained by the facts established by earlier conditions. In this code, after 'if (guess == answer) { ... } else { ... }', the 'else' block only runs when 'guess != answer'. Inside that block, 'if (guess > answer) ... else { if (guess < answer) ... else ... }' already covers all remaining possibilities: 'guess > answer' or 'guess < answer'. There is no possible execution where the innermost 'else' is reached, because the only remaining logical option ('guess == answer') was already excluded by the outer 'if'. The student\u2019s structure shows a misunderstanding of how prior conditions restrict later ones and leads to dead, unreachable code.",
