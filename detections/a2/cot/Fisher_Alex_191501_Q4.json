The student does not fully trust the structural guarantee of the 'for' loop initialization and continuation condition.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The Java execution model guarantees that any code executed within the body of the outer loop (lines 23-37) must have satisfied the condition `currentRowNumber >= 1`. The explicit condition `if (currentRowNumber > 0)` on line 29 is logically redundant and shows a belief that variables might unaccountably change state or require re-validation when passing into a subordinate code block.",

They see programming as needing constant localized checks to avoid hypothetical edge cases that have already been handled globally.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student fails to recognize the role of conditional logic (like the guard `if (userInputHeight > 0)` at line 23 and the loop boundary conditions `currentRowNumber = 1; currentRowNumber <= userInputHeight`) in establishing preconditions for the subsequent block of code. The check `if (currentRowNumber > 0)` inside the loop is redundant, as the loop initialization `currentRowNumber = 1` guarantees the condition is always met for all iterations.",

          "conceptual_gap": "In modern Java (and C-style languages), defining a loop variable within the `for` loop header (`for (int i = 1; ...`) is standard practice and confines the variable's scope to the loop, minimizing name collisions and improving clarity. By declaring `currentRowNumber` outside the loop (Line 20) and then setting it inside the header (Line 25), the student creates an unnecessary globally scoped variable that is only meaningfully used within the `for` loop, bloating the containing method's scope.",
