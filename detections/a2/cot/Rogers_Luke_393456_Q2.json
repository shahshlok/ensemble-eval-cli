          "conceptual_gap": "While the code correctly validates and discards bad input (Line 29), it fails to loop back immediately to the prompt (Line 15) to request input again. Instead, it only proceeds to update the loop condition (`!correct`), which is still true, and then tries to execute the loop body again, but without giving the user a new prompt before potentially waiting for input again, leading to confusing behavior or skipping the prompt text if bad input is encountered.",
          "error_manifestation": "If the user inputs anything that is not an integer (e.g., 'hello'), the program consumes it, then loops without printing the prompt 'Guess a number (1-100): ' before waiting for the next input.",
