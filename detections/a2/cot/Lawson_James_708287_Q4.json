          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that when updating a variable based on its existing value (e.g., iterating a counter), they must calculate the updated value into a separate temporary variable first. This suggests a fear of simultaneous read/write conflict or a belief that assignments like `col = col + 1` are inherently risky or ambiguous, preferring a clear two-step staging process.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, assignment of primitive types is atomic and the right-hand side expression is fully evaluated using current variable states before the result is assigned. Idiomatic constructs like `col++`, `row++`, or `col = col + 1;` are safe, efficient, and standard practice. The use of temporary variables (`tempCol`, `tempRow`) is highly redundant and demonstrates a lack of trust in basic arithmetic assignment operations.",

This includes using `if (true)` for initialization and using checks like `if (row != 0)` repeatedly, suggesting a misunderstanding of sequential program flow guarantees or an overly defensive approach where variables are suspected of spontaneously adopting illegal values.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The checks `if (row != 0)` are logically redundant because `row` is initialized to 1 and only increments, guaranteeing it is non-zero within the main loop body.

This pattern indicates a flawed mental model regarding the necessity of conditionals and the stability of variable state in sequential execution.",

Furthermore, including checks like `if (true)` (L12) or checks for non-zero values (`if (row != 0)` at L27 and L34) where the logic guarantees a non-zero value, suggests a fundamental insecurity or misunderstanding of basic sequential execution and initialization guarantees.",

Furthermore, using a `while (row <= N)` loop with a positive starting condition (`row = 1`) and a negative `N` value (e.g., N=-4) would simply result in the loop condition being immediately false (1 <= -4 is false), causing zero rows to print.
