          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that when the user guesses correctly, the comparison logic (lines 28-36) executes fully, printing 'Correct!', and *then* the `while` loop condition at L24 (`currentUserGuessValue != secretNumberAnswer`) will automatically re-evaluate and terminate the loop immediately without an additional iteration or input prompt.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The Java `while` loop condition is only evaluated *before* the loop body executes, or after the loop body finishes executing (to determine if the next iteration should start). In this code, when the user guesses correctly, the loop body executes completely (including printing 'Correct!'). Crucially, the loop condition IS NOT checked again until the *next* intended iteration. Since the code only prints 'Correct!' inside an `else` block which handles the correct guess, there is no mechanism to break the loop or prevent the next evaluation. The loop condition is `while (currentUserGuessValue != secretNumberAnswer)`, which is now false, so the loop terminates naturally after printing the success message and completes the program execution.",
          "error_manifestation": "None. While the structure is slightly unconventional (using the loop condition solely for entry/termination rather than an explicit `break`), the logic functions correctly. The 'Correct!' output happens on the iteration when the guess matches, and the loop terminates gracefully before prompting for input again.",
