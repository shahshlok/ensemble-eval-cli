The student does not treat the failure of a prior condition (e.g., not an 'A') as sufficient information to implicitly define the upper boundary for the current range (e.g., 'B').",
          "conceptual_gap": "The Java `if-else if` structure guarantees sequential exclusion. Since grades are checked in descending order (90+, then 80+), reaching an `else if` block (e.g., for B) implies the grade failed the previous check (i.e., grade < 90). Therefore, the check for the upper boundary (`grade <= 89`) is logically redundant and unnecessary to enforce correct domain partitioning. The student fails to utilize the implicit domain filtering provided by sequential flow control.",

For example, after failing the check for A (>= 90), the student still explicitly checks for `< 89` in the B condition, failing to rely on the sequential nature of `else if` to handle the upper bound.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In execution environments like Java, `else if` statements are checked sequentially. If an `else if` block is reached, it is guaranteed that all preceding `if` or `else if` conditions evaluated to false. Therefore, when checking if a `grade` is in the B range (80-89), it is sufficient to check `grade >= 80`, because if the grade were 90 or above, the previous block (A) would have executed. Explicitly checking the upper bound (`grade <= 89`, `grade <= 79`, etc.) is redundant, although harmless in this specific logical structure (it just makes the code unnecessarily verbose).",
