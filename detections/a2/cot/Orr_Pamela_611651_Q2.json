          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that variables must be copied into new names (`tempGuess`, `final_guesses`) before being used in critical or concluding calculations (like comparisons or final output strings). This suggests a lack of trust in the immediate stability of the original variable's state, or a failure to realize that the scope and sequential nature of operations already preserve the necessary values.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, primitive variables maintain their state until explicitly modified or until they fall out of scope. Creating temporary variables (`tempGuess`, `final_guesses`) solely to hold the value of existing variables (`userGuess`, `guess_count`) for immediate, singular use (comparison or output) is logically unnecessary. This shows inefficient resource use and a minor misunderstanding of variable persistence within sequential code blocks.",

They do not realize that within the `else` block (where the guess is known to not equal the answer), failing the `> answer` condition automatically implies the `< answer` condition, making the final explicit check redundant.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student implemented a nested `if-else if-else` structure using sequential `if-else` blocks (L30-L38). By the time execution reaches L34 (`if (tempGuess < answer)`), two conditions have already been excluded: `tempGuess == answer` (L28) and `tempGuess > answer` (L31). Therefore, the condition at L34 should logically be handled by a simple `else`, as it is the only remaining possibility for an integer comparison. This demonstrates a failure to leverage the logical guarantees provided by nested `if/else` structures.",
