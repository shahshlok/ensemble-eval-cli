          "conceptual_gap": "The core of the Java execution model is designed to handle repetition efficiently through iterative structures (for/while loops).

The code works correctly by repeating the conditional check and accumulation logic five times for five individual variables. However, the student fails to grasp the concept of aggregation and iteration, leading to highly redundant and unmaintainable code. The student does not utilize conditional flow control (if statements) or explicit looping structures (for/while), instead relying on five separate variable declarations and sequential ternary operator expressions to mimic iteration and selection.",
