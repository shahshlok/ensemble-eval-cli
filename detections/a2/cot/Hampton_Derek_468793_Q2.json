          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, the assignment operator evaluates the entire right-hand side expression to a final value before assigning it directly to the variable on the left-hand side. Using separate temporary variables (e.g., `temp_answer`, `temp_guess`, `final_count`) immediately followed by an assignment to the intended variable (e.g., `answer`, `guess`, `guess_count`) is redundant and does not affect the execution model or state, as direct assignment would suffice (e.g., `int answer = rand.nextInt(100) + 1;`).",
