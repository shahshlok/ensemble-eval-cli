          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that for a specific number of repetitions (N=5), the required processing logic (reading input, checking parity, updating sum) must be manually written out as a sequence of distinct code blocks, necessitating unique variable names for each step.",
          "conceptual_gap": "Java's execution model includes control flow structures, specifically loops (`for` or `while`), designed to execute a block of code repeatedly without manual duplication. The student demonstrates a failure to abstract the repetitive task into an iterative structure, treating the required actions as a strictly sequential list of unique steps rather than recognizing the opportunity for control flow repetition. This suggests an incomplete mental model of how the machine executes iterable logic.",
          "error_manifestation": "Extreme code redundancy and poor scalability (e.g., if the requirement changed from 5 to 100 inputs, the code would be impossible to maintain). The sequential tracing of the redundant logic correctly generates the required output for N=5, masking the underlying structural flaw.",

          "conceptual_gap": "The student failed to use iteration (like `for` or `while` loops) to process the five inputs efficiently and correctly. In programming, repetitive tasks involving the same logic applied to sequential data points are handled using loops, which reuse the same variables (or array indices) for input reading, processing, and accumulation, simplifying the code base significantly and reducing the risk of manual errors (even though no logical error occurred in this specific implementation). The student's approach unnecessarily bloats the code by requiring 5 distinct input variables (`a, c, e, g, i`) and 5 temporary check variables (`b, d, f, h, j`).",
