They seem to think this manual increment will just help the outer loop progress correctly from row to row, without realizing it immediately changes the loop conditions controlling both loops.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, the variable used as a for-loop counter is an ordinary variable. The loop header (for (init; condition; update)) does not create a separate hidden counter; it simply uses that variable in the condition and updates it at the end of each iteration. Any change to that variable inside the loop body takes effect immediately and will influence the loop's next condition check. Here, the inner loop condition is currentStarCount <= currentRowNumber, and the student increments currentRowNumber inside that same inner loop. Because currentStarCount and currentRowNumber are both increased by 1 each iteration, the relation currentStarCount <= currentRowNumber remains true forever, so the inner loop never terminates and the program prints an infinite stream of '*'. The correct model is that the outer loop variable should not be modified inside the inner loop; the outer loop already advances currentRowNumber once per row via its own update clause, and the inner loop should use its own independent counter (currentStarCount) to control the number of asterisks.",

By manually incrementing this variable inside the nested inner loop (L21), the student causes two critical errors: 1) The inner loop's limit (`currentRowNumber`) increases at every step, allowing the inner loop to run far too long (eight times instead of one on the first conceptual row, resulting in 10 stars printed before termination). 2) The outer loop's control variable is inflated much faster than intended, causing the outer loop to immediately violate its condition (`currentRowNumber <= 4`) after the first sequence of inner loop execution, leading to premature program termination.",

By incrementing `currentRowNumber` inside the inner loop, the student unintentionally couples the growth of `currentRowNumber` to `currentStarCount`. In this specific program, both `currentStarCount` (from the `for`'s `currentStarCount++`) and `currentRowNumber` (from the manual `currentRowNumber = currentRowNumber + 1;`) increase together, so the condition `currentStarCount <= currentRowNumber` remains true forever, causing an infinite inner loop.
