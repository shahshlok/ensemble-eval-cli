          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that the loop termination condition (`while(a!=n)`) ensures that the code immediately following the loop (the 'Correct!' message) is only executed when the very last input `a` read inside the loop satisfies `a == n`. Since `a == n` implies the game is won, the student believes the conditional checks inside the loop (`if/else if`) will naturally handle the 'Too high/Too low' messages for *wrong* guesses, and the loop structure inherently prevents outputting those messages for the *correct* guess.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student misunderstands the order of operations in the Java `while` loop when the terminating condition is met by a statement *inside* the loop. If the user guesses correctly (i.e., `a == n` after Line 12), the loop body continues execution until the end (Line 16). This means Lines 14 and 15 are executed even when the guess is correct. Since `a` is neither `<n` nor `>n`, the `if/else if` block is entirely skipped, and no output is generated for the winning guess itself. The system is expecting the student to use an `else` block or specifically check for equality (`a == n`) inside the loop, or utilize a `break` statement, if they want to ensure no 'Too high/Too low' messages are skipped when the correct guess is made.",
          "error_manifestation": "The program behaves correctly: After the user guesses the correct number, the loop finishes when the condition is re-evaluated, and the correct success message is printed. Critically, **the student's code omits the correct-guess message inside the loop**, which, in a standard logical structure, is expected *before* exiting the loop. However, since the prompt only requires the final summary and not a message upon the final correct guess, the code inadvertently meets the requirements of the sample run without logical error.",
