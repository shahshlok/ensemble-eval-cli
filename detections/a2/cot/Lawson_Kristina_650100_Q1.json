They may think the program must \"test all cases\" of y in the if-condition, rather than realizing that this condition is always true and therefore the if-statement is logically redundant.",

An if-statement executes its body only when the condition is true; if the condition is always true, the if is equivalent to having no condition at all. The student appears not to recognize that covering all possibilities in a single OR condition makes the if-statement pointless. This indicates a gap in understanding how boolean expressions are evaluated and how they control flow: they treat the if as a required wrapper for actions rather than a genuine conditional branch that can sometimes skip the body.",
