          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that for a series of mutually exclusive grade ranges (A, B, C, D, F), every conditional check, even within an `else if` chain, must explicitly define both the lower and upper bounds of the range (e.g., 80 <= grade <= 89) to guarantee that the correct letter is assigned. Furthermore, the student confirms the 'F' condition explicitly, despite initializing the letter grade to 'F' and falling into the final `else` block which already implies the grade is below 60.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student does not trust or fully utilize the flow control mechanism of the `if-else if` structure. In this structure, the failure of preceding conditions automatically establishes an implicit upper bound for subsequent checks. For instance, if the code reaches `else if (grade >= 80)`, it is already guaranteed that `grade < 90`. Similarly, the final `else` block covers all remaining cases (grades < 60), making the separate check `if (temp_grade_holder < 60)` redundant.",

          "conceptual_gap": "The student unnecessarily copies `numeric_grade` to `temp_grade_holder` (Lines 11, 13, 16) before performing range limiting (which is arguably useful, but then the original variable is ignored) and classification logic. They also copy the final result `letterGrade` to `final_letter_grade` (Line 39) right before printing. This demonstrates confusion about variable scope, variable modification, and the machine state model, where values persist unless explicitly changed. This padding/redundancy does not affect correctness but suggests a lack of trust in basic assignment semantics.",

          "conceptual_gap": "In an `if-else if` chain structured for ranges (like line 25: `temp_grade_holder >= 80 && temp_grade_holder <= 89`), the upper bound check (`<= 89`) is redundant because if the grade were 90 or higher, the previous `if` block (Line 23) would have executed and the program would have skipped this `else if`. The range check is conceptually flawed because the primary `if` (Line 23) successfully defines the boundary (anything 90+), making subsequent upper limit checks unnecessary once the lower limit is established. The explicit check for `< 60` inside the final `else` (Lines 35-37) is also strictly unnecessary since reaching that `else` already implies the grade is not 60-100.",
