They are implicitly relying on the ordering of the conditions to create the ranges instead of writing explicit upper bounds or using `else if`.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, each `if` statement is evaluated independently. The truth of one `if` condition does not prevent later `if` conditions from being evaluated. For a value like `grade = 85`, the expressions `grade >= 80`, `grade >= 70`, and `grade >= 60` are all true at the same time. Because the code uses separate `if` statements rather than an `if`\u2013`else if` chain or explicit range checks (e.g., `grade >= 80 && grade < 90`), the program will execute every `if` whose condition is true and therefore print multiple letter grades. The correct execution model is: for each `if`, Java evaluates its boolean expression using the current value of `grade`; if it is true, that block runs, regardless of earlier `if`s. There is no automatic exclusivity or range partitioning just from ordering the `if`s. To match the grading scale, the student must either (1) use `if` / `else if` / `else` so that only the first true condition executes, or (2) write non-overlapping conditions that include both lower and upper bounds for each letter grade.",
