          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that printing the 'Correct!' message within the `if/else if/else` block is sufficient to terminate the entire program or, at minimum, prevent further execution of the loop iteration.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student confuses the `else` block (which handles the success case) with a terminating condition for the `while` loop. In reality, Java's control flow dictates that after the `else` block (or any block in the loop body) finishes, execution returns to the `while` condition check on L28 (`while (userGuessValue != secretNumberAnswer)`). Since the success case *sets* `userGuessValue == secretNumberAnswer`, the loop correctly checks the condition and terminates *before* the next iteration, not immediately after the successful guess is processed.",
          "error_manifestation": "None. The code functions correctly because the loop condition is checked immediately after the successful guess is processed. However, including the success message and variable update inside the loop structure, rather than breaking the loop explicitly or restructuring to a do-while, suggests a misunderstanding of how the `while` loop condition determines immediate flow versus flow for the next iteration.",

          "conceptual_gap": "The student uses unnecessary temporary variables and verbose steps for simple tasks like incrementing a counter (`totalNumberOfGuesses++` or `totalNumberOfGuesses = totalNumberOfGuesses + 1`) or calculating a comparison (`if (guess > answer)`). This suggests a lack of trust in the compiler/runtime to handle direct arithmetic or condition checks efficiently, or a belief that intermediate state variables are necessary for the machine to 'remember' the process.",
