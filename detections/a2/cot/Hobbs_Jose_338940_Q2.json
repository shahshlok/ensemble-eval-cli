          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that when the loop condition `while(g!=n)` is finally satisfied (i.e., `g == n`), the block of code inside the loop must execute one last time to process the correct guess before exiting and proceeding to the final print statement.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The `while` loop condition is checked *before* entry. If the condition `g != n` is false (meaning the guess `g` equals the secret number `n`), the loop body is immediately skipped. The student's code contains logic (printing 'Too low!' or 'Too high!') that should not execute on the final correct guess, but because the control flow dictates checking the condition *before* executing the body, the branch that handles incorrect guesses is bypassed correctly. The key misconception lies in the placement of the check vs. the actions taken when the guess is correct: the code correctly avoids incorrect feedback, but if the student had placed the success message inside the loop, the logic would have been fundamentally flawed.",
          "error_manifestation": "No functional error in this specific implementation, but the structure suggests a potential flaw in understanding loop termination and conditional execution. When the correct guess is input (Line 11), the subsequent `if/else if` statements (Lines 13-14) correctly avoid printing 'Too high!' or 'Too low!' because neither `g < n` nor `g > n` is true. The loop then terminates correctly. This implementation is robust, but the structural dependency on the final guess falling through all conditionals is characteristic of students who might otherwise struggle with loop structures.",
