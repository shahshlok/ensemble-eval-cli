While functionally correct, this structure suggests a lack of confidence in Java's ability to handle standard arithmetic assignment (e.g., `sum_even += x;` or `sum_even = sum_even + x;`) or a belief that variables must be explicitly defined and assigned step-by-step for complex expressions, even when the underlying expression is simple.",
