The runtime does not remember that a previous if was true and therefore does not automatically skip later ifs; all of them are checked in order unless you explicitly use else if / else or control-flow statements (like return, break, etc.) to prevent later checks.

To get mutually exclusive behavior, the student must either: (1) use an if/else-if/else chain so that only the first true condition runs, or (2) make the conditions mutually exclusive by including upper bounds (e.g., grade >= 80 && grade < 90).",
