For example, the 'B' grade check (line 28) is only reached if the previously checked 'A' grade condition (>= 90) failed. Therefore, the grade is already guaranteed to be less than 90, making the explicit upper bound check (`&& numericGradeValue <= 89`) logically redundant and obscuring the simpler intended logic.",
