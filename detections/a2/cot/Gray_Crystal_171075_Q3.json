          "conceptual_gap": "The student fails to utilize the cascading control flow provided by the `if-else if` structure. In an `if-else if` chain, the flow only progresses to subsequent checks if preceding conditions have failed. For example, if the first `if (y >= 90)` fails, it is implicitly known that `y < 90`. Subsequent `else if` blocks only need to check the lower range bound (e.g., `y >= 80`), avoiding the redundant explicit upper boundary check seen in lines 12-14.",

If a later condition is also true, it will overwrite the variable assignment made by a previous true condition. While the student's range checks (e.g., L11-L15) are carefully constructed to be mutually exclusive for valid grades (0-100), the student failed to use an `else if` structure, relying entirely on the conditions themselves to prevent multiple assignments, which is usually less robust and computationally less efficient.",

However, if the ranges had overlapped or used different bounds, the sequential execution of independent `if` statements would lead to incorrect overwrite logic.",
