          "conceptual_gap": "The `while` loop condition check only determines whether the *next* iteration should start. If the condition is true, the entire loop body executes sequentially until the end. If a guess inside the loop body (lines 31-32) makes the condition false (i.e., `userGuessNumber == secretAnswerNumber`), the program still proceeds to execute the rest of the conditional logic (lines 35-44), including the `else` block which prints 'Correct!'. The final check in line 27 only stops the *next* potential iteration.",
          "error_manifestation": "The 'Correct!' message and guess count are calculated and displayed correctly inside the loop when the correct guess is made. However, immediately after displaying the success message, the loop continues to run the comparison logic (lines 35-44) unnecessarily because the prompt statements (lines 30-34) are not skipped, resulting in redundant logic execution before the loop condition check at line 27 finally terminates the loop.",
