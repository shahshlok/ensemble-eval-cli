Consequently, they feel the need to explicitly verify the boundaries of the 'F' grade range (`grade_copy >= 0 && grade_copy < 60`) inside the `else` block before assigning the grade, demonstrating a lack of confidence in the control flow structure's implicit constraints.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, an `if-else if-else` structure guarantees mutual exclusion. Since the first four checks covered grades 60 through 100, the final `else` block (L31) is guaranteed to execute *only* if `grade_copy < 60`. As the input was previously clamped between 0 and 100 (L13-18), the grade is guaranteed to be in the [0, 59] range. The inner `if` statement is logically redundant and shows the student does not trust the `else` keyword to function as the negation of all preceding conditions.",

          "conceptual_gap": "The Java `if-else if` structure is sequential. Once a condition is met, the remaining `else if` blocks are skipped. Therefore, when checking for `grade >= 80`, it is implicitly known that the grade is less than 90 (or 100, if that was the prior check), making the upper bound check (`&& grade <= 89`) redundant and unnecessary if the conditions are ordered from highest grade to lowest.",

          "conceptual_gap": "The purpose of initializing `char letterGrade = 'F'` (L21) is to handle all grades below 60 implicitly.

The inner `if (grade_copy >= 0 && grade_copy < 60)` (L32) is redundant because any grade reaching this block *must* be in that range (or an invalid negative grade, which the bounds check on L15 already implicitly handled by setting it to 0).
