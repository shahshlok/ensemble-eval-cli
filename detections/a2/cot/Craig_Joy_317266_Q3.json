          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, `letter_grade` is initialized to the character literal `'F'` (numeric value 70) on Line 23. This variable is subsequently guaranteed to be assigned 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', or remain 'F'. Because the variable is always initialized and assigned valid, non-zero characters, the check `if (letter_grade != 0)` (which checks against the null character) is logically impossible to fail and is entirely superfluous. This suggests the student is treating the character variable as a potentially unassigned or default-zero flag, possibly influenced by C-like initialization safety concerns, which are largely mitigated by Java's guarantee of local variable initialization.",

The literal `0` in `letter_grade != 0` is just the numeric value 0 (the null character `\\u0000`), not a special 'uninitialized' or 'no value' marker. Local variables like `letter_grade` do not get an automatic default value; the compiler enforces explicit initialization before use. Here, `letter_grade` is explicitly initialized to `'F'`, so it can never be 0, and the condition `letter_grade != 0` is always true.
