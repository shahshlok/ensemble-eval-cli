          "conceptual_gap": "The student failed to account for the necessary logic flow when the guess is correct. Specifically, if `guess == answer`, neither `guess < answer` nor `guess > answer` is true, meaning no output is produced. While the loop correctly terminates, the problem statement implies, and standard practice dictates, that the user should be immediately informed that they guessed correctly upon entering the correct number, *before* loop exit. The common structure for this game uses an `else` clause (or an explicit `guess == answer` check) to print 'Correct!' inside the loop, or structured conditional printing to ensure the 'Too high/Too low' messages are *only* printed for wrong guesses. The student's implementation correctly avoids printing a hint, but it fails to print the 'Correct!' message until the loop fully terminates, which is outside the prompt/response cycle.",
          "error_manifestation": "Missing immediate feedback (no 'Correct!' message) upon the final, correct guess before the loop terminates. However, since the prompt only dictates hints for *wrong* guesses, and the final 'Correct! You took X guesses.' is printed afterward, the student's logic is technically functionally correct, but structurally unusual and brittle.",

          "conceptual_gap": "This initialization forces the use of a value (`0`) that is outside the valid range (1-100) just to satisfy the initial loop check. While strictly correct because the first input is read inside the loop, expert programmers often use `do-while` loops for input tasks where execution must happen at least once, avoiding the need for a 'pre-loop' dummy initialization and leading to cleaner code structure.",
