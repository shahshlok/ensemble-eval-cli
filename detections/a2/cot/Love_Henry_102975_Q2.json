          "conceptual_gap": "The initialization value for `userGuess` (0) is chosen correctly, but its role is only to ensure the first loop condition check (`userGuess != answer`) evaluates to true, thus guaranteeing entry. Since `answer` is restricted to [1, 100], any number outside this range (e.g., -10, or 101) would equally serve as a valid sentinel value to prime the loop. Relying specifically on 0 suggests the student might not fully generalize the requirement that the initial value must simply fail the exit condition.",

          "conceptual_gap": "For an indefinite loop where the exit condition depends on user input taken inside the loop, the `do-while` structure is often conceptually clearer because it performs the action (get input) at least once before checking the condition. Using a standard `while` loop necessitates either priming the variable with a value guaranteed to fail the initial check (like 0 here) or placing the input operation before the loop starts, leading to code duplication. The student chose the 'priming' method, which is functionally correct but demonstrates a potential rigid adherence to a standard `while` loop pattern where a `do-while` loop would be more semantic for this specific task.",

          "conceptual_gap": "The loop condition `while (userGuess != answer)` already guarantees that the loop will not repeat if the guess is correct. Therefore, the success message and guess count printing (Lines 29-30) occur only on the final iteration, and the logic checking `else` (meaning `userGuess == answer`) is redundant. If the guess is correct, the two branches (`if userGuess < answer` and `else if userGuess > answer`) are skipped, the success message is printed, and the loop naturally terminates upon meeting the condition check at the next iteration start (Line 18). While not causing failure, including the success handling within the iteration-specific feedback structure (`if-else if-else`) shows a lack of full recognition of how the `while` condition bounds the purpose of the loop's body (which should ideally only handle incorrect guesses).",
