They are mentally associating the initialization `b=1` with the update step, rather than realizing that all three parts of the for-loop header are independent expressions.",

The language does not infer which variable is the 'loop counter'; it simply runs exactly what is written: initialize `b` to 1, test `b <= a`, and then increment `a`. Because `b` never changes and `a` keeps increasing, the condition `b <= a` remains true for a very long time, creating an effectively non-terminating inner loop that prints an enormous number of asterisks and also corrupts the outer loop counter. The student\u2019s mental model incorrectly assumes a semantic link between the variable in the initialization (`b`) and the update step, instead of understanding that the programmer must explicitly increment the same variable used in the condition (`b` in this case).",

The outer loop's control variable (`a`) is continuously incremented by the inner loop.\nSince `a` increases indefinitely and `b` stays at 1, the inner loop condition (`b <= a`) remains true, resulting in an infinite loop shortly after execution begins.

In the student's inner loop, the condition `b <= a` depends on `b`, but the increment expression only changes `a`. As a result, `b` is never incremented and stays at 1, while `a` keeps increasing. Since `1 <= a` remains true forever as `a` grows, the inner loop never terminates. The student is implicitly assuming that because they wrote `for(b=1; ...; ...)`, the loop machinery will internally tie the increment to `b`, even if they write `a++` in the increment position.
