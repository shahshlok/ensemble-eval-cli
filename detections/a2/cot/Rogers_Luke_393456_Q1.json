          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that when updating a variable based on its current value (e.g., `sum = sum + value` or `count = count + 1`), the result must first be stored in a temporary, new variable name (`newSum`, `newCount`) before assigning that result back to the original variable (`sum` or `count`). This suggests a resistance or lack of understanding regarding direct self-assignment or compound assignment operators.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The assignment operator (`=`) in Java evaluates the expression on the right-hand side using the current variable values and then assigns the result to the variable on the left, automatically overwriting the previous value. Direct statements like `sum = sum + value;` or `count++;` are the standard and efficient way to perform these updates. The use of intermediate variables is unnecessary and signals a conceptual hurdle regarding variable reassignment semantics.",
