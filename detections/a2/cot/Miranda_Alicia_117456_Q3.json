          "conceptual_gap": "The student misunderstands the efficiency of structured `if-else if` logic when determining ranges. Once the main external check `if (grade >= 0 && grade <= 100)` (L13) establishes the input validity, subsequent checks do not need to check the upper or lower bounds if they rely on the previous failure. For example, after failing `grade >= 90`, the next block only needs to check `grade >= 80`, because the structure of `else if` guarantees `grade` must be less than 90. The student explicitly checks both bounds (`&& grade <= 89`, `&& grade <= 79`, etc.), which is redundant for correct operation but demonstrates a lack of comprehension regarding how range partitioning works efficiently in chained conditionals.",

          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, the variable `letterGrade` is explicitly initialized on L11 as `String letterGrade = \"\";`. Because it is initialized to an empty string, it can never be `null` within the scope of this program section, and if the main logic block (L13-L27) executes, it will receive a non-empty value (A, B, C, D, or F). The final check `if (letterGrade != null && letterGrade.length() > 0)` (L29) is always true if a grade was processed or false only if the input was invalid and resulted in the empty string set on L11, which would be covered by the assignment on L27 (`letterGrade = \"F\";`). This check is redundant, showing the student unnecessarily defensive coding or a misunderstanding of how Java string initialization and nullability work.",
