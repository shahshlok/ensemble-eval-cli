They seem to treat currentRowNumber as both the row index and the star counter, and think incrementing it inside the inner loop will help match the number of stars to the row.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, a for-loop\u2019s control variable is meant to be managed by the loop header, and changing it inside nested loops changes the loop\u2019s behavior in non-obvious ways. Here, the outer loop variable currentRowNumber should represent the fixed row number for the duration of that row, while the inner loop variable currentStarCount controls how many stars are printed. By incrementing currentRowNumber inside the inner loop, the student ties the inner and outer loops together: both currentRowNumber and currentStarCount increase in lockstep, so the condition currentStarCount <= currentRowNumber remains true indefinitely. This leads to a non-terminating inner loop and prevents the triangle from being formed. The gap is not recognizing that each loop needs its own independent counter and that the outer loop counter must not be mutated inside the inner loop body.",
