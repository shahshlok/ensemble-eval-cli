The student repeatedly adds unnecessary conditional wrappers: 1) `if (true)` around standard input, 2) `if (N != 0)` around the main loop (which the `while (rowCount <= N)` condition already handles safely when N=0), and 3) `if (rowCount != 0)` around the inner loop (where `rowCount` is initialized to 1 and is always positive).
