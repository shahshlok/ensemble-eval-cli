          "conceptual_gap": "The student has misunderstood the control flow of the while loop. When invalid input is provided, the code consumes it but does NOT increment guessCount or compare it with the answer. The loop then immediately re-prompts without any indication that an invalid attempt occurred. More critically, the guessCount is only incremented for valid integer inputs, but the problem semantics are unclear about whether invalid inputs should count as guesses. However, the real issue is that invalid input silently fails to advance the game state, which is poor UX and suggests the student didn't think through what happens when `hasNextInt()` is false.",
          "error_manifestation": "When a user enters non-integer input (e.g., 'abc'), the program consumes it but doesn't count it as a guess or provide feedback. It simply re-prompts. This creates an infinite loop of re-prompting without progress if the user keeps entering invalid input. The program also doesn't explicitly tell the user their input was invalid.",

They should either (1) inform the user the input is invalid, or (2) treat invalid input as an incorrect guess (though this may not be the intended behavior). The student's approach silently skips invalid inputs, which violates the principle of providing clear user feedback.",

          "conceptual_gap": "The student fails to realize that when invalid input (which is discarded in the 'else' block) is processed, the `guessCount` is not incremented, and the user is not notified that their input was bad. Critically, if the user enters a non-integer, the loop continues, the system prompts again, and the `guessCount` remains stuck at 0 (or whatever it was before the invalid input). When the user finally enters a valid number, that number is processed, and the game proceeds correctly from there. The conceptual gap is the lack of a proper error message and the implicit assumption that the user will always enter valid input eventually without needing explicit recovery instructions or controlled loop iteration management for invalid inputs.",

It skips the core logic (comparison, hints) and loops back to the prompt without telling the user what happened, potentially confusing the user.
