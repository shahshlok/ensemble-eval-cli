Once the outer loop (`for (int row_index = 1; row_index <= safe_N; row_index++)`) begins, `row_index` is guaranteed to be 1 or greater within that loop's body. Assigning `row_index` to `temp_row` (Line 19) means `temp_row` is also guaranteed to be 1 or greater for the duration where it is used.

          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, assigning a primitive type variable (`int N`) to another primitive type variable (`int safe_N`) creates a copy, which is fine, but the copy is entirely unnecessary here since `N` is not modified after input (except through the assignment to `safe_N`). Similarly, the control variable `row_index` is scope-limited and its value is perfectly safe and intended to be used as the bound for the inner loop. Creating `temp_row` (Line 19) adds no logical or execution safety and shows a fundamental distrust of the variable stability provided by the loop construct itself.",
