          "conceptual_gap": "The student fails to recognize that expressions like `sum = sum + value;` (or the equivalent shorthand `sum += value;`) calculate the right-hand side using the current value of `sum` and then immediately overwrite `sum` with the result, making the intermediate variable `newSum` redundant. This indicates a limited understanding of mutable variables and the efficiency of the assignment operator.",
