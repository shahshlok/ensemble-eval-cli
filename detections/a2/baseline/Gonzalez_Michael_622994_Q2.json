          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that the standard sequence of check/input/process/feedback/check should occur in the loop, but has structured the `if-else if-else` block such that the success feedback (and program termination) is included within the sequence of feedback for incorrect guesses, leading to redundant output.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student fails to recognize the necessary structure of a guessing loop when using a `while` condition based on the comparison (`userGuess != secretNumber`). The loop's primary purpose is to *get* the guess and provide feedback *if* the guess is wrong. Processing the correct guess should either happen *outside* the loop body (if using a sentinel trigger) or, if included inside, the conditional logic must strictly prevent further execution of the `Too high`/`Too low` checks and, more importantly, prevent the correct output message from appearing on every subsequent iteration (which is prevented here by the structure, but the primary logic flow is flawed). The crucial error is printing the 'Correct!' message and guess count *before* the loop condition is re-evaluated, but after the execution which necessitates that message. While the logic works due to the `break`-like effect of the while loop terminating, including the success message and counter increment *before* the terminal condition check is evaluated is an unusual and fragile structure. However, the most direct manifestation is the execution of the main feedback block even when the loop condition is met on the last iteration, which leads to the program outputting the 'Too high' or 'Too low' feedback *before* the 'Correct!' message if the logic were slightly misordered. More saliently, the student's current logic prints the 'Correct!' message for the final guess *before* the loop terminates, but the problem is that *all* lines within the loop are executed during the final winning iteration, including the input and counter increment, meaning the core logic requires the `if/else if/else` block to execute the winning case rather than terminating immediately upon a wrong answer and letting the loop handle it.",
          "error_manifestation": "Wrong output sequence/redundancy. The structure includes the success outcome feedback (Correct! You took X guesses.) within the repetitive loop body intended for input and error feedback, leading to the success message being printed immediately before the loop naturally terminates, rather than controlling the loop's execution based only on incorrect answers.",
