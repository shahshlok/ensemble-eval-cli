          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that identical operations (reading input, checking parity, accumulating sum) performed on a fixed set of items (N=5) must be realized by uniquely naming N variables and writing N separate, distinct code blocks for each one. They treat the program structure as merely a linear sequence of unique steps, rather than recognizing a repeatable pattern suitable for a 'for' loop or array processing.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The fundamental gap is the failure to utilize the concept of iteration (loops) and data abstraction (arrays or collections) necessary for scalable programming. In Java, repetitive tasks on multiple data points are best handled by structuring data into arrays or processing input streams within a loop construct (like `for` or `while`). The student's mental model lacks the concept that a single, generalized block of code can be repeated efficiently by the processor.",
          "error_manifestation": "While the output is correct for the specific requirement of N=5, the code is excessively verbose, highly redundant, and entirely non-scalable (e.g., if the problem required 500 inputs).",

          "conceptual_gap": "The student fails to recognize that loops (like `for` or `while`) are the standard mechanism in Java (and programming in general) for handling repetitive actions, especially those involving a fixed, known number of iterations or inputs. This leads to rigid, error-prone, unmaintainable, and non-scalable code. The actual Java model supports efficient iteration through control structures rather than requiring explicit sequential duplication of instructions.",
