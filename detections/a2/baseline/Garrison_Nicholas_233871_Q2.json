          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that a correct guess must be handled *only* after the loop evaluates the termination condition, and therefore the logic for declaring success (including printing the final message) should be placed after the loop body finishes iterating.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java's `while` loop structure, the body executes as long as the condition is true. Once the condition becomes false (meaning `userGuessValue == secretNumberAnswer`), the loop terminates. The student correctly uses an `if/else if/else` block inside the loop to determine the relationship between the guess and the secret number. However, the final `else` block already handles the 'Correct!' scenario, which should also trigger the loop exit immediately after the response is printed. By placing the success print statement *only* within the `else` block (Line 41) *and* using the loop condition `while (userGuessValue != secretNumberAnswer)` (Line 23), the program correctly executes the success logic inside the loop and then terminates.",
          "error_manifestation": "None. The code is logically correct, but the structure suggests an expectation that success output should often be delayed until after the loop, which would typically lead to incorrect repetition or missing output in other contexts. In this specific case, the `else` block handles the success print correctly.",

This tendency suggests a hesitation to perform simple operations inline, possibly due to a belief that the machine needs explicit, separate steps for temporary storage.",
