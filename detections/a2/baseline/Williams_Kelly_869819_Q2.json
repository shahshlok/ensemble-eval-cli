However, they fail to recognize that nextInt(100) already generates [0, 99], making their formula generate [1, 100] correctly by accident, but their mental model of what 'a' represents is flawed.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student appears to have confusion about what nextInt(n) returns. The method nextInt(n) returns a value in [0, n-1], not [1, n]. While their code happens to work (nextInt(100) + 1 = [1, 100]), the way they set up variables (a=100, b=1) suggests they think nextInt(100) gives [0, 100] or they're treating 'a' and 'b' as arbitrary parameters without understanding the actual contract. A proper understanding would be: nextInt(100) gives [0, 99], so adding 1 gives [1, 100].",
          "error_manifestation": "The code actually produces correct output for the given problem, but the conceptual understanding is incomplete. The student used unexplained intermediate variables (a, b, c) rather than directly implementing the hint formula, suggesting confusion about the underlying semantics.",
