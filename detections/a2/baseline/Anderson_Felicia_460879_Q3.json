No additional lower-bound check is needed there; simply printing D would be correct. By introducing a second threshold (`e = 65`) inside that branch, the student accidentally creates a gap and overlap in the ranges. In addition, the final `else` is attached only to the inner `if (grade >= e)`, not to the whole outer chain, so inputs below 60 are not handled at all.
