They feel they must explicitly bound the range (e.g., check `G <= 89` for a B grade) to prevent falling through from a range like 'C' (70-79) if the grade was hypothetically 95 and somehow missed the 'A' check, or to prevent a lower grade like 85 from potentially satisfying a higher grade's check (although logically impossible upstream).",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student fails to recognize that Java's `if-else if` structure is sequential and exclusive. By the time the execution reaches an `else if`, all preceding `if` and `else if` conditions have already been evaluated as false. Therefore, for grading based on decreasing thresholds, checking the upper bound (e.g., `userInputGrade <= 89`) is redundant because the code is only reached if `userInputGrade` is already less than 90 (the boundary for 'A'). The actual boundary constraint is implicitly maintained by the flow of control.",

By the time we reach `else if (userInputGrade >= boundaryB && userInputGrade <= 89)`, we already know that `userInputGrade < 90`. Therefore, the upper bound check `<= 89` is logically redundant. Similarly, the check `<= 79` in the C branch is redundant (we know grade < 80), and `<= 69` in the D branch is redundant (we know grade < 70). However, while this is inefficient and shows poor understanding of control flow, it does not cause incorrect output in this specific case because the redundant conditions are still logically consistent with the requirements.",
