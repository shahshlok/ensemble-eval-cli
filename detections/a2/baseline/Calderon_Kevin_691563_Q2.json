          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that when the correct answer is guessed, the loop should immediately exit and terminate the program flow. They have placed the success message inside the `else` block (which executes when `userGuess == answer`), but incorrectly assume that executing this block and meeting the loop termination condition (`userGuess != answer` becomes false) will prevent further execution of the loop body content after the success message prints.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In a `while` loop, even if the termination condition is met during the execution of the loop body (e.g., inside an `if/else` structure), the loop only checks the condition again *before* the start of the next iteration, not immediately after the successful guess and execution of the `else` block. Since the block printing 'Correct!' is the last thing in the loop body, this logic is actually correct *if* the success message were meant to be displayed inside the loop. The bug is the output logic: the student is intentionally printing the success message even though it causes the loop to terminate *after* that print.",
          "error_manifestation": "The student's implementation is actually *correct* and follows the provided sample run structure exactly, although placing the success output inside the loop body is generally less clean than using a `break` or moving the output outside the loop if the loop body contained further side effects. No tangible error results from this specific implementation, but it reveals a misunderstanding of typical loop control patterns where success messages are often printed *after* loop exit.",
