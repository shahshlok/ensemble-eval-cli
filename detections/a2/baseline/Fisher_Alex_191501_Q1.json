If invalid input is encountered, the input should be consumed but its iteration should not be counted toward the required total, effectively forcing the program to wait until 5 *valid* inputs have been supplied.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In a fixed iteration structure intended to read 'N' tokens of input, the loop counter should typically increment after each read attempt, whether successful or not, unless the program is specifically required to continually prompt/retry until a valid input is received. By making the counter increment (Line 39) dependent on successful validation and using `continue` (Line 35) upon failure, the program reads more than 5 tokens if invalid input is present, and will block indefinitely if the input stream ends before 5 valid integers have been successfully processed.",

          "conceptual_gap": "The assignment requires reading 5 input tokens provided by the user, regardless of their type, to satisfy the `reading 5 integers from the user` instruction (implying 5 interactions or 5 tokens consumed, based on typical CS1 assignments). The student's implementation attempts to read 5 *successful* integers. If an unexpected token (non-integer) is provided (e.g., `3 8 hello 2 7 4`), the `while` loop continues past 5 iterations because the counter (`currentLoopIndex`) is only incremented when `userInputScanner.hasNextInt()` is true and an integer is processed. This logic divergence means the program will stall or read more than 5 numbers if invalid input is fed, violating the requirement of processing a fixed block of 5 inputs.",
          "error_manifestation": "The program reads more than 5 tokens if invalid input is mixed in, potentially leading to a hang if the input stream terminates before 5 valid integers are reached, or processing unexpected additional data.",
