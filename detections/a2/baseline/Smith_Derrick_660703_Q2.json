          "conceptual_gap": "The student misunderstands how `nextInt()` works. `rand.nextInt(100)` returns a value in the range [0, 99], not [1, 100]. Adding 1 gives [1, 100], but the student has assigned `a = 100` and `b = 1`, then called `rand.nextInt(a) + b`. This generates numbers in [1, 100], which happens to be correct by accident. However, the student's mental model appears confused about why this works - they're not using the correct formula structure. The hint specifically says `rand.nextInt(100) + 1`, but the student abstracted this into variables without understanding the mathematical relationship. If a student truly understood the formula, they would recognize that `nextInt(100)` generates [0, 99] and adding 1 shifts it to [1, 100].",

          "conceptual_gap": "There is a logical contradiction in the control flow. The loop continues `while (userGuess != c)`, meaning when `userGuess == c`, the loop should exit. However, inside the loop, when `diff == 0` (meaning `userGuess == c`), the program prints \"Correct!\" and then the loop condition is re-evaluated. Since `userGuess == c` is now true, the loop exits naturally. While this works correctly, it shows the student doesn't fully understand that the loop condition itself already handles the termination - the internal check is redundant. A clearer mental model would recognize that once the guess is correct, the loop will exit due to the condition, making the internal `if` statement partially unnecessary (though the print statement is needed). The student seems to view the loop condition and the internal check as separate concerns rather than understanding they're controlling the same thing.",

          "conceptual_gap": "In Java (and most imperative languages), the `while` loop condition is only evaluated at the start of each iteration. When the correct guess is made, the program prints the success message, but execution continues through the subsequent `if/else if/else` structure (which is fine), and then reaches the end of the loop body. The loop will only terminate *before* the next iteration if the condition `userGuess != c` (Line 18) evaluates to false. However, because the success message and subsequent printing of 'Too low!' or 'Too high!' happens in the same iteration where `userGuess == c`, the loop naturally continues to the end of the current iteration before checking the condition again. The student failed to include an explicit loop control mechanism (like `break` or wrapping the `System.out.println` statements) to prevent unwanted output after a correct guess within the successful iteration.",

Then, because the structure of the `if/else if/else` is flawed when combined with the loop termination logic, it checks the remaining conditions and prints an additional, incorrect message ('Too high!' or 'Too low!') before the loop condition is finally evaluated and fails.",
