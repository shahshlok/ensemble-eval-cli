          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, an `else` is always paired with the closest unmatched `if`, and nesting changes the set of values each branch handles. In this code, `else if (grade >= 60)` restricts control flow to grades 60\u2013100 that did not match previous branches. Inside that block, `if (grade >= 65) ... else ...` only executes for grades in that 60\u2013100 window, so the `else` corresponds to grades 60\u201364, not to all grades below 60. As a result, grades below 60 never reach any `println`, and grades 60\u201364 are misclassified as `F` even though, per the specification, 60\u201369 should be `D`. The student appears to mentally treat the nested `if` as a refinement that doesn't affect the overall partition of cases, rather than recognizing that the nesting changes which values each `else` covers.",

The student appears to think that subdividing ranges requires nesting, rather than using separate non-nested conditions or a single compound condition. Additionally, they don't recognize that by the time execution reaches line 38, they've already eliminated grades 90+, 80+, and 70+, so the only grades reaching that block are 60-69\u2014yet they still add an extra subdivision.",
