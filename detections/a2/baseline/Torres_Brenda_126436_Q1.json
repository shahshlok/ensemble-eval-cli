The condition (y != 0 || y == 0) is a tautology: for any int value of y, either it is not zero or it is zero, so the expression is always true. In Java, if-statements do not add any special semantics beyond evaluating the boolean expression; an if whose condition is always true is equivalent to having no if at all. This suggests the student may view if-statements as required 'ceremony' around assignments or as something that must enumerate all cases to be valid, rather than as selective control flow that executes only for some input cases. Note: despite this misconception, the program still computes the correct sum for all inputs, because x is always assigned y.",
