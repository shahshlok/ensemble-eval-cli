If the input is invalid (a non-integer token), that input should be consumed and ignored, but it should not count toward the required total of 5 inputs.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The conceptual gap is that the mechanism controlling the loop (the counter `count`) tracks successful data extraction events (`nextInt`), rather than tracking the overall number of tokens read from the input stream as required to meet the 'read 5 items' constraint. If invalid input is provided, the counter stalls, causing the program to potentially consume an infinite number of invalid tokens while waiting for 5 *valid* integers to satisfy the loop condition.",

The student seems to think that creating `newSum` and `newCount` is necessary for the computation to be valid, when in fact this adds unnecessary complexity. This suggests a misunderstanding of how assignment and expression evaluation work in Java\u2014specifically that expressions are evaluated and their results can be directly assigned.",

Therefore, the null check on line 23 is conceptually misguided and won't catch or handle invalid input appropriately. The real issue is that invalid input causes the program to skip the increment of `count`, potentially creating an infinite loop, which the student hasn't addressed.",
          "error_manifestation": "If non-integer input is provided, the program enters an infinite loop because `count` is never incremented when invalid input is encountered (line 20 is only reached after valid integer input).

          "conceptual_gap": "The student correctly attempts to handle invalid input using `scanner.next()` in the `else` block (Line 23). However, not incrementing the loop control variable (`count`) within this `else` branch means that if 5 non-integer inputs are provided consecutively, the loop will become infinite or process fewer than 5 *valid* integers if the user keeps entering bad data, potentially hanging the program if interaction is required, or failing if 5 valid numbers are required to terminate the loop iteration count.",
