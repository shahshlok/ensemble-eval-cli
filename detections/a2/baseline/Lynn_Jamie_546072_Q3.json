However, they check if(n>=65) inside this block, which means grades 65-69 correctly print D, but they've also left the outer else-if(n>=70) to handle C grades. The real issue is that there's no explicit else clause after the nested if statement that catches the F grade case for the n<70 path, and the structure becomes confusing. Actually, upon closer inspection: when n is 60-64, the outer else-if(n>=60) is true, the inner if(n>=65) is false, so the inner else executes printing F\u2014which is correct.
