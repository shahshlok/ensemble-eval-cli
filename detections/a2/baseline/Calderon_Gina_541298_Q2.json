          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that once the `guess == answer` condition is met inside the `if/else if/else` block, the program execution will immediately jump out of the `while (guess != answer)` loop, perhaps because the `else` block containing the 'Correct!' message implies termination.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student fails to recognize that conditional statements (`if`, `else`) only determine which block of code runs *within the current iteration* of the loop. If the condition for the correct guess is met, the program prints 'Correct!' and then proceeds to the next step: re-evaluating the loop condition (`while (guess != answer)`). In this case, since `guess == answer`, the loop correctly terminates. However, the structure places the 'Correct!' output *inside* the loop. If the problem had required no output on the final correct guess, this structure would be incorrect. In this specific scenario, the code is technically correct because the requirement is to print 'Correct!' upon guessing correctly, and then terminate. But the conceptual error lies in structuring the final output as a standard iterative outcome rather than a dedicated success case which determines termination *after* the output.",
