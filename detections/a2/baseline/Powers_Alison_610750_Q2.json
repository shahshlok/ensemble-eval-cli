          "conceptual_gap": "The student fails to apply direct relational operators (`>`, `<`, `==`) efficiently within the main control flow statement (`if/else if/else`). Instead, they introduce several temporary variables (`differenceBetweenGuessAndAnswer`, `comparisonIndicator`) and multiple assignment steps (L27, L28, L31, L33, L35) to perform a comparison that could be achieved by evaluating `if (userGuessValue > secretAnswerValue)` directly. While the logic *ultimately* works, it suggests a reluctance or misunderstanding of using the basic boolean outcomes of relational expressions in Java control structures.",
