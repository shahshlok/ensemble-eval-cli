          "conceptual_gap": "The sequential nature of the `if-else if` structure provides mutual exclusivity. When an `else if` block is reached, it is guaranteed that all preceding conditions failed. Since the logic is ordered from high grades (A) to low grades (D), reaching the B condition (`else if (grade_copy >= 80 && grade_copy <= 89)`) implies that `grade_copy` is already less than 90, making the constraint `grade_copy <= 89` redundant for logical correctness. This pattern is repeated consistently and is further emphasized by the highly redundant final `else` block for grade 'F', demonstrating a lack of trust in control flow sequencing.",
