          "conceptual_gap": "The student has misunderstood how `nextInt()` works. `nextInt(n)` returns a value from 0 to n-1 (not 0 to n). Therefore, `nextInt(100)` returns 0-99, and adding 1 gives 1-100. However, the student created variables `a` and `b` to store these values instead of using the literal values directly as shown in the hint. More critically, the student assigned `a = 100` and `b = 1`, but the actual computation `rand.nextInt(100) + 1` is correct. The issue is a misunderstanding of the parameter semantics: `nextInt(100)` does NOT mean 'generate a random number in range 100', it means 'generate a random number from 0 to 99'. The student's implementation happens to work correctly by accident because they used the right numbers, but the mental model suggests they don't fully understand why this works.",
