          "conceptual_gap": "The student computed a variable `c` but never used it anywhere in the program. This suggests a misunderstanding about whether intermediate calculations need to be stored, or confusion about what values are actually needed to solve the problem. The variable `c` is completely irrelevant to the nested loop structure that prints the triangle.",
          "error_manifestation": "The code still produces correct output despite the unused variable, but it demonstrates confused thinking about the algorithm. The unused variable suggests the student may not fully understand the minimal requirements for the solution.",

          "conceptual_gap": "While not technically wrong, the creation of `j_start = 1`, `j_end = i`, and `j_step = 1` suggests the student may have over-generalized a pattern or misunderstood the simplicity of the required loop. This could indicate confusion about when abstraction is beneficial versus when it adds unnecessary complexity. The student treats a simple `for (int j = 1; j <= i; j++)` as if it needs to be parameterized.",
          "error_manifestation": "The code produces correct output, but the approach suggests a mental model that doesn't distinguish between necessary and unnecessary abstractions. This is a style/clarity issue more than a functional bug, but it hints at conceptual confusion about loop design.",
