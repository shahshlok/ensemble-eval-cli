          "conceptual_gap": "The student has incorrectly put the increment statement for the outer loop control variable (`row++`) inside the inner loop's header, replacing the necessary increment for the inner loop variable (`star++`). This causes an infinite loop because the outer loop variable (`row`) is incremented both at the end of the outer loop body (implicitly by the outer loop header) AND continuously by the inner loop's header. Java's `for` loop executes the 'update' expression in the header after each inner iteration. Because the variable being incremented in the inner loop is `row` (which controls the outer loop), the value of `row` immediately changes, violating the outer loop's condition and/or leading to premature termination/infinite looping (in this case, an infinite loop on the first iteration of the outer loop if we consider the scope and structure). Specifically, `row` starts at 1. The inner loop condition `star <= row` is true (1 <= 1). The inner loop prints '*', and then `row` is incremented to 2. The inner loop condition is checked again (1 <= 2). Then `row` is incremented again. Since `row` is never reset and will quickly exceed `n`, and the inner loop body prints, this creates an erroneous state. More critically, the inner loop never increments `star`, trapping the inner loop in an infinite cycle because `star` remains 1 while `row` increases indefinitely or until overflow.",

By incrementing `row` instead of `star`, the inner loop's condition (`star <= row`) never becomes false (`star` stays at 1 while `row` only increases), so the inner loop never terminates. At the same time, `row` is being modified in two places (both loops), breaking the intended iteration structure.

Inner runs 1 time, increments row to 2. Outer continues. row=2 (outer). Inner runs 2 times: row->3, row->4. Outer continues. row=5. Loop terminates. Output is only 2 lines (1 star, 2 stars).",
