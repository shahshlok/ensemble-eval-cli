They may think an if-condition is required syntactically, without realizing a bare `println` would work, or they may not understand that this condition is always true.",

The expression `n != 0 || n == 0` is a tautology: for any integer `n`, one of these must be true, so the entire condition is always true. This makes the `if` completely redundant; the body will always execute and is no different from just calling `System.out.println(...)` unconditionally. The student's code is functionally correct for the problem, but the condition suggests a gap in understanding how `||` works and how to reason about boolean expressions, rather than a clear mental model that the condition is unnecessary.",
