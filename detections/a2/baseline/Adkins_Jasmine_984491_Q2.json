          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that calling `rand.nextInt(100)` generates a number between 1 and 100, and that adding 1 to it will ensure the range is correct. They set `a = 100` and then use `rand.nextInt(a)` followed by `+ 1`, thinking this produces a number in the desired range.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student misunderstands how `nextInt()` works. `rand.nextInt(100)` returns a value in the range [0, 99], not [1, 100]. Adding 1 produces [1, 100], which is correct. However, the student's approach of first assigning `a = 100`, then calling `rand.nextInt(a)`, then adding 1 is overly convoluted and suggests incomplete understanding. More critically, the student may not fully grasp that `nextInt(n)` returns values from 0 to n-1, not 1 to n. While the final result happens to be correct by accident, the intermediate variable assignments indicate conceptual confusion about the semantics of random number generation.",
          "error_manifestation": "The code produces correct output by coincidence. The range [1, 100] is achieved, but the mental model is flawed because the student appears to have arrived at this through trial-and-error or incomplete understanding rather than clear conceptual reasoning.",

          "conceptual_gap": "The loop condition is checked only *before* each iteration begins. Once an iteration starts, all code within the loop body executes sequentially until the end of the block is reached, or a flow control statement (like `break`) is encountered. In this case, when the correct guess is made, the `if-else if-else` structure *is* fully executed, printing the 'Correct!' message. The loop condition check then occurs, fails, and only then does the loop terminate.",
          "error_manifestation": "The program correctly identifies the correct guess, reports the number of guesses, and then immediately re-prompts the user for another guess inside a new, unnecessary loop iteration because the logic to exit the loop (via the `while` condition) only takes effect after the iteration where the correct answer was processed finishes. This results in an extra, incorrect prompt and loop cycle.",
