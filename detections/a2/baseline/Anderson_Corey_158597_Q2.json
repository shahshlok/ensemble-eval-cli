          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that when the loop condition (`currentUserGuessValue != secretAnswerValue`) evaluates to false, the loop terminates immediately, and the code execution that follows represents the state *before* the correct guess was processed. Specifically, they fail to account for the case where the very last block of code that ran *inside* the loop (the `else` block containing the 'Correct!' message) is exactly what happened when the condition finally failed, and therefore, they do not realize the comparison/output logic applies to every guess, including the successful one.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student implemented logic where the 'Correct!' message and the loop exit condition occur concurrently within the loop body. When the `else` block (correct guess) executes, the loop immediately terminates on the *next* check of the `while` condition. Because the 'Too high/low' checks only precede the 'Correct!' check, the 'Correct!' message is only printed when a correct guess is made, and subsequently, the loop breaks. The student's code correctly incorporates the final message printing *inside* the loop block where the correct guess is handled, resulting in redundant final message printing outside the loop being unnecessary. The student seems to have correctly implemented the logic, but usually, this structure sometimes reveals a potential confusion about where the final success output belongs when using a `while (input != secret)` loop structure.",
