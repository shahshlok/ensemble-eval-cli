In the inner loop `for (int star = 1; star <= row; row++)`, the student initializes `star` but never changes it; instead, they increment `row`, which belongs to the outer loop. The actual execution model is: on each inner-loop iteration, only the expression in the third clause (`row++`) is executed, so `row` grows without bound while `star` stays at 1. Since the condition is `star <= row`, this quickly becomes permanently true, leading to a (practically) non-terminating inner loop and preventing the correct triangle from being printed. The student\u2019s code therefore does not produce the required pattern and suggests a misunderstanding that the loop condition or Java itself will somehow advance `star` automatically, rather than requiring an explicit `star++`.",

This leads to an infinite loop or incorrect termination criteria based on integer overflow because the `row` variable is being incremented twice (once by the inner loop, once by the outer loop after the inner loop finishes, assuming it ever finishes).
