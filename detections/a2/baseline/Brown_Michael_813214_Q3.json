          "conceptual_gap": "The Java 'if-else if-else' structure enforces mutually exclusive execution paths. If an 'else if' condition is evaluated, it is guaranteed that all preceding 'if'/'else if' conditions failed, which implicitly sets the upper bound for the current check. For example, explicitly checking 'safe_grade <= 89' for a 'B' grade is unnecessary because the failure of the 'A' grade check (safe_grade >= 90) already ensures safe_grade < 90. This pattern complexity, particularly the redundant checks in lines 25, 27, 30, and the final highly redundant 'else' block, indicates a misunderstanding of flow control's power to simplify boundary logic.",
