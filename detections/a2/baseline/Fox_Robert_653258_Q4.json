          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, `if` conditions control flow only when their boolean expression can evaluate to both true and false depending on program state. The expression `x != 0 || x == 0` is a tautology: it is guaranteed to be true for every possible value of `x`. Using it in an `if` statement means the body will always execute, making the `if` entirely redundant. This suggests a misunderstanding of boolean logic (how `||` works, and how conditions relate to possible values) or of the purpose of conditionals (treating them as something you add around blocks \"just because\" rather than to distinguish different cases). The Java execution model does not do any special checking beyond evaluating the boolean expression exactly as written; it does not interpret such conditions as range checks or safety guards.",

This makes the `if` statement logically pointless\u2014it will always execute its body regardless of the value of the variable. A correct mental model is that conditions should express a *real decision* (e.g., `if (x != 0)` to skip work when x is zero), and that `P || Q` is true whenever at least one of `P` or `Q` is true, so using mutually exclusive comparisons with `||` cannot filter anything out.
