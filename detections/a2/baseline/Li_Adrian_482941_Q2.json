          "conceptual_gap": "When the loop condition `while (b != a)` is evaluated, if `b` is equal to `a` (meaning the student guessed correctly in the *previous* iteration), the loop terminates. However, because the guess count `c` is incremented immediately after reading the guess, it correctly accounts for the guess that terminated the loop. The logic for providing feedback (`Too high/Too low`) is contained within `if/else if`, which is correct because those branches are skipped when `b == a`. There is no logical flaw or conceptual gap resulting in incorrect behavior in this specific implementation, despite the potentially tricky structure of checking the condition primarily in the `while` header. The absence of an `else` branch for the correct guess prevents incorrect output.",
