Furthermore, the student does not trust the final `else` block to capture the remainder of the domain, requiring a nested explicit check (`if (temp_grade_holder < 60)`) to ensure the correct value ('F') is assigned.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In a cascaded `if-else if` structure designed to check ranges sequentially (e.g., 90+, then 80+), subsequent checks do not need to check the implicit upper bound (e.g., `<= 89`), because the failure of the prior, higher condition (e.g., `not >= 90`) guarantees the necessary boundary.

          "conceptual_gap": "The student fails to recognize the principle of variable use efficiency. Java's execution model treats assignments and reassignments to the same variable name efficiently. Introducing redundant variables (`temp_grade_holder` holding the value of `numeric_grade`, and later `final_letter_grade` holding the value of `letterGrade`) doesn't change the program's logic or protect the original variable from being altered in subsequent lines, as these new variables are used immediately instead of the originals.
