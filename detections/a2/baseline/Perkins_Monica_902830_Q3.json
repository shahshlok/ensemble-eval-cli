          "conceptual_gap": "In Java's conditional structure (if/else if/else), execution stops at the first successful condition. The student's model fails to account for this implicit range checking. For example, when checking for B (80-89), they check for `numericGradeInput >= 80 && numericGradeInput <= 89`. Since the block for A (90-100) immediately precedes it, if the flow reaches the 'B' check, it is already guaranteed that `numericGradeInput < 90`. Including the explicit upper bound check (`numericGradeInput <= 89`) is redundant, but the explicit lower bound check (`numericGradeInput >= 80`) is necessary. The use of redundant checks indicates a lack of trust in or understanding of the execution flow of cascaded conditionals.",

Furthermore, because the preceding `else if` conditions failed (D, C, B, A checks), it is implicitly guaranteed that the grade is `< 60`. Therefore, checking `numericGradeInput >= 0` is entirely redundant. A simple `else` on the previous conditional structure would have been sufficient and idiomatic, or at most, a check for just the upper bound if they insisted on using `else if` (i.e., `numericGradeInput < 60`).
