          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that the `Correct!` message should be printed inside the loop when the guess is equal to the answer, and that the loop will terminate naturally after this message is printed, resulting in a clean exit without any extra output.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student's model correctly identifies the loop termination based on `while (guess != answer)`. However, when `guess == answer`, the loop completes one final iteration. Inside this final loop body, the correct branch (`else`) is executed, printing 'Correct!'. Crucially, the loop then immediately re-evaluates its condition (`guess != answer`), finds it false, and terminates. The misconception is not about the loop termination, but about the *unnecessary* execution of the 'Correct!' print statement on every single, successful final guess, which is logically redundant since this exit condition itself implies success. While the code works correctly according to the requirements, a more idiomatic and efficient approach would be to structure the loop such that success is only handled *after* the loop terminates, or by using a `break` to exit immediately upon success.",
