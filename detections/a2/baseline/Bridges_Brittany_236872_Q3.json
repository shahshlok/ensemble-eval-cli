          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that when using `if-else if` structures for sequential range checks, they must explicitly check both the lower and upper bounds for every range (e.g., `grade >= 80 && grade <= 89`) to prevent the grade from erroneously falling into a higher category.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In a correctly structured sequential `if-else if` block, once a condition is met (e.g., `grade >= 90`), subsequent conditions in the `else if` chain are not evaluated. Therefore, for the 'B' grade check (`grade >= 80`), it is redundant and often extraneous to check the upper bound (`grade <= 89`) because we already know the grade must be less than 90 (or it would have triggered the 'A' block). The student lacks understanding of how the sequential, exclusive nature of the `if-else if` structure simplifies range determination.",
