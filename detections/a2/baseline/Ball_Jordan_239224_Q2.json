          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that using the != operator to compare strings checks if the strings have different values, similar to how it works with primitive types like integers.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, the != operator compares object references, not the actual string content. For string comparison, the .equals() method should be used. The condition `if (badInput != null)` checks if the reference is not null, which will always be true after scanner.next() successfully returns (since it returns a String object, not null). The student appears to think this comparison validates the input value, but it only checks for null references.",
          "error_manifestation": "The error handling for invalid input will always print 'Please enter an integer.' whenever non-integer input is provided, but the logic is correct in this case only by accident because scanner.next() won't return null. However, the mental model is flawed because the student is using reference comparison for what should be content validation.",

          "conceptual_gap": "The student creates `tempGuess` and assigns `scanner.nextInt()` to it, then assigns `tempGuess` to `guess`. This is unnecessarily verbose. While not technically wrong (the code works correctly), it suggests a misunderstanding about variable assignment and the stability of method return values in Java. The student may believe that the result of scanner.nextInt() is unstable or that direct assignment is unsafe.",
