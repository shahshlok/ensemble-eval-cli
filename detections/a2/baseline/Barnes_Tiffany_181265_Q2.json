          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that rand.nextInt(100) generates a number between 1 and 100 inclusive, so they create variables a=100 and b=1, then calculate c = rand.nextInt(a) + b to get the secret number.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student has misunderstood how rand.nextInt() works. The method rand.nextInt(100) returns a value from 0 to 99 (inclusive), not 1 to 100. Adding 1 to this result gives a range of 1 to 100, which is correct. However, the student's approach of assigning intermediate values to variables a and b, then computing c = rand.nextInt(a) + b, while functionally correct, suggests they may not fully understand that rand.nextInt(100) + 1 directly produces the required range. More importantly, if a student modifies 'a' or 'b' later, the code would break silently without clear understanding of why.",

          "conceptual_gap": "The loop termination logic relies on the loop condition changing when userGuess equals secretNumber, rather than explicitly breaking or using a clear flag. When a correct guess is made (diff == 0), the if-block is empty, and the loop exits on the next condition check. This works functionally, but suggests the student may not have a clear mental model of when and how to explicitly control loop termination. A clearer approach would be to either explicitly break when correct or provide immediate feedback with a separate condition flag.",

          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that structured conditional logic (if-else if-else) is only necessary to categorize actions (printing 'Too high!' or 'Too low!') but fails to recognize that the primary purpose of the loop condition (`while (userGuess != secretNumber)`) is rendered ineffective if the loop body logic continues execution without utilizing the early exit mechanism (break) for the correct case, or if the loop structure itself is designed to continue execution only for incorrect guesses.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student has correctly identified the three outcomes of a guess (correct, too high, too low) using an `if-else if-else` structure. However, they placed the 'correct' action block (where `diff == 0`) as an empty block `{}` within the loop, relying solely on the loop condition (`userGuess != secretNumber`) for termination. Because the check for 'Too high' and 'Too low' happens *after* the guess count is incremented, and the loop continues running until the next iteration when the `while` condition is re-evaluated, the final output statement reporting 'Correct!' is only executed *after* the loop terminates. The core logical error is that upon a correct guess, the accompanying feedback ('Correct!...') is suppressed until after the loop ends, but more importantly, the student provides no feedback (like 'Correct!') within the loop when the guess is right. The empty `if (diff == 0)` block prevents the necessary positive feedback from being displayed at the moment of the correct guess, even though the program flow eventually leads to the correct count being displayed outside the loop.",
          "error_manifestation": "Wrong output/Missing output. If the user guesses correctly, the program terminates without displaying the 'Correct!' message until *after* the loop, but the logic inside the loop means no message is printed at all for the correct guess, leading to a poorer user experience than required by the prompt (which implies the 'Correct!' message should be part of the successful guess sequence). However, the primary bug is the omission of the success message when `diff == 0` is true.",
