          "conceptual_gap": "The core misunderstanding is that the loop's success path executes, prints the success message, and *should* exit the loop immediately, but the logic allows the success message to be printed even though the loop continues to iterate (or rather, the success message is printed, and then the loop *immediately* exits, but the issue is the redundant comparison logic). This specific implementation, however, has a more subtle flaw regarding feedback display when the guess is correct.",
          "error_manifestation": "When the user guesses correctly, the output includes the success message, but it also incorrectly prints the 'Too high!' or 'Too low!' message if the logic were slightly off, or in this specific case, it prevents extraneous output by using `else` on the last branch. The actual issue is that the loop structure is slightly inefficient, but functionally correct in terms of output and termination when using `else` for the correct guess. Therefore, no severe output error is manifest, but a structural misunderstanding of loop control flow often accompanies this structure.",
