The student fails to integrate the filtering effect of the preceding failed `if-else` conditions, treating each nested `if` as an entirely independent check.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java's execution model, an `else` block is only evaluated if the previous `if` condition was false. Because the checks are sequential (A, then B, then C, etc.), failure of the 'A' condition (grade >= 90) guarantees that the grade is less than 90 (or less than 89 in integer terms) when the code proceeds to check for B. Therefore, explicitly checking the upper bound (`grade <= 89`) is redundant. This suggests a weak understanding of how the sequential, mutually exclusive nature of the `if-else` structure simplifies compound conditions.",
