          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that after the loop condition becomes false (meaning the user guessed correctly), the program immediately terminates, or that the loop structure itself handles the termination of the application flow after a successful guess.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student implemented the successful guess output (`System.out.println(\"Correct! You took \" + totalNumberOfGuesses + \" guesses.\");`) inside the loop, specifically within the `else` block (lines 35-37). When the guess is correct, this message is printed, the loop condition (`currentUserGuessNumber != secretAnswerNumber`) becomes false, and the loop *exits*. Normal program flow continues *after* the loop (line 42). Since there is no `break` statement after printing the 'Correct!' message, the program continues to execute the remaining statements in the loop body if the successful guess was not the very first guess read at line 26 of the current iteration. However, in this specific implementation, because the success condition is tied to the `else` block (meaning `currentUserGuessNumber == secretAnswerNumber`), the execution path guarantees that the loop terminates immediately after printing the correct message, but the logic structure suggests a misconception about where successful output should reside.",
          "error_manifestation": "Logical flaw in structure, but results in correct output functionality. The correct output message is unnecessarily printed before the loop condition is re-evaluated, potentially causing redundant code execution if the success output was placed before the evaluation. In this case, the student's logic works because the 'Correct' message is only printed when termination occurs, but it reflects a misunderstanding of separating iteration logic (the loop structure) from success/failure outcomes.",
