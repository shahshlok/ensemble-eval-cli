          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that when using an `if-else if` structure, each conditional block must independently verify both the lower and upper boundaries of its range. Consequently, they include checks like `grade < a` within the `else if` blocks, failing to leverage the program flow implicit in the sequential conditional evaluation.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The Java `if-else if` structure guarantees mutual exclusivity. If execution reaches an `else if` block, all preceding `if` and `else if` conditions must have been false. For instance, reaching the check for B (`grade >= 80`) automatically implies that the condition for A (`grade >= 90`) was false, meaning `grade < 90` is already guaranteed. Explicitly including `&& grade < 90` (or `grade < a`) is logically correct but unnecessary, indicating a lack of trust or understanding regarding sequential conditional execution.",
