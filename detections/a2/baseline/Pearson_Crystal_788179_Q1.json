          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that conditional execution (only adding inputs that meet a condition) must be implemented by converting the boolean condition into a binary multiplier (0 or 1) and multiplying the input by this multiplier before summation. This approach is used instead of a standard 'if' statement, suggesting a preference for masking data arithmetically rather than branching execution flow.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The Java execution model provides dedicated control structures (`if/else`) for branching based on conditions, which are clear and efficient. The student's approach utilizes several intermediate variables (`a`, `b`, `c`) and arithmetic operations (lines 9-12) to manually *emulate* conditional assignment and summing. This complexity shows a reluctance or lack of understanding regarding the appropriate use of standard conditional flow control mechanisms (`if` statements) provided by the language.",
