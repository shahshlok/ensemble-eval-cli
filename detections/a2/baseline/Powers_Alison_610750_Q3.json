          "conceptual_gap": "When using 'if-else if' for sequential range checking (e.g., high grade to low grade), the structure ensures that if code execution reaches an 'else if', all prior conditions were false. This means the upper bound check is redundant. For instance, to check for a 'B' grade (80-89), checking 'grade >= 80' is sufficient because if the grade were 90 or above, the path would have been taken by the preceding 'A' condition.",

The student thinks that without explicitly stating the upper bound in each condition, grades outside the intended range might incorrectly match that condition.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student doesn't fully understand how if-else chains work in Java. In an if-else structure, once a condition is true and its branch executes, all subsequent else-if conditions are skipped. Therefore, checking the upper bound (e.g., '<= 89' in the B grade condition) is logically unnecessary because if the grade were >= 90, it would have already matched the A condition. The upper bound checks don't cause incorrect behavior here, but they reveal a misunderstanding of control flow.",
