This means the last value taken by `row` is `height - 1`, so only `height - 1` rows are printed. To get exactly `height` rows when starting at 1, the condition must be `row <= height`. The gap is in understanding that the loop bound is about the condition being true on each check, not about the apparent numeric range the student has in mind.",
