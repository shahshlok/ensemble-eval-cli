          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, `else` always pairs with the closest unmatched `if`, regardless of indentation. Because there are no braces, the `else` on line 21 is bound to `if (grade_value >= 65)` on line 19, not to the outer `if`/`else if` chain that tests the other ranges. As a result, the `else` only executes when `grade_value >= 60` (from line 18) and `grade_value < 65` (failing the inner `if`), i.e., for grades 60\u201364. Grades below 60 are never handled by any branch and therefore produce no output at all. Additionally, the condition `grade_value >= 65` incorrectly narrows the D range to 65\u201369 instead of the specified 60\u201369, so the mapping of numeric ranges to letter grades does not match the problem specification.",
