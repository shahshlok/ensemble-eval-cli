          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that a correct guess read and processed within the `while` loop body will immediately terminate the loop flow, preventing subsequent iterations once the correct output is printed.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student misunderstands the execution model of a `while` loop. The loop condition (`userGuess != answer`) is checked only *before* the loop body executes and *after* the loop body completes. Even if `userGuess` becomes equal to `answer` inside the loop, the loop body continues to execute completely until it reaches the end, at which point the final check terminates the loop before another iteration begins. The structure used allows the success message to be printed, but that success message is immediately followed by a jump back to the loop header (L15) where the condition fails, thus exiting the program gracefully but inefficiently.",
          "error_manifestation": "No incorrect output or runtime error occurs, but the loop is structured inefficiently. More critically, if the student had only wanted to print output *after* the loop (a common pattern), the loop structure would have led to an infinite loop if the final logic check were missing, demonstrating a flawed mental model of loop termination strategy.",
