          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, the != operator compares object references, not string content. While this particular usage (bad != null) happens to work for null checks, the student may not understand that this is checking reference equality, not value equality. The broader misconception is that direct comparison with != is appropriate for string operations.",
          "error_manifestation": "While this specific code works for the null check, the pattern demonstrates a misunderstanding of how string comparison should be done in Java. If the student extended this to compare string values (e.g., bad != \"test\"), it would fail.",
