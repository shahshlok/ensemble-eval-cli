They do not recognize that the failure of the prior checks (e.g., failing `grade >= 90`) implicitly guarantees the upper bound for the current range (`grade < 90`).",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student has an incomplete mental model of control flow optimization in sequential conditional logic. The conceptual gap is failing to leverage the guarantees provided by the `else` clause in an `else if` chain. Since Java executes these blocks sequentially, if the current `else if` block is reached, the condition of the preceding checks must have been false, implicitly defining the upper limit for the current grade range. For example, by the time line 19 is reached, it is already guaranteed that `grade < 90`, making `grade <= 89` redundant.",

They think that checking `grade <= 100` in the A grade condition, `grade <= 89` in the B grade condition, etc., is necessary to prevent overlap between ranges.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student doesn't fully understand how if-else chains work in Java. Once a condition is satisfied and a branch is taken, subsequent else-if conditions are never evaluated. Therefore, by the time we reach the B grade check, we already know the grade is less than 90 (because the A condition failed). The upper bound checks are logically redundant and create a false sense of safety. More importantly, this approach is brittle: if the boundary values don't align perfectly (as they do here), the logic still works by accident, but it suggests a misunderstanding of control flow.",
          "error_manifestation": "The code produces correct output for most test cases, but this is only because the upper bounds happen to align with the next threshold minus 1.

For example, the B condition checks `grade <= 89`, but since we already know `grade < 90`, this check is unnecessary.",
