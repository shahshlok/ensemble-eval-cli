They may believe that declaring and computing these variables somehow 'sets up' the program or validates the input, when in fact the loop logic works independently of these computations.",
          "error_manifestation": "The program produces correct output, but contains dead code (unused variables `b` and `c`). This suggests a conceptual misunderstanding about what code is necessary versus unnecessary, potentially indicating the student doesn't fully understand the control flow of their own program.",
