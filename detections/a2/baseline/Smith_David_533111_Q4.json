As i increases and j stays at 1, the condition `j <= i` remains true forever, so the inner loop never terminates. Additionally, modifying the outer loop\u2019s control variable (i) inside the inner loop breaks the outer loop\u2019s intended behavior. The gap is a misunderstanding that loop headers and loop variables are somewhat symbolic rather than tightly coupled to specific variables that must be updated consistently for correct termination.",
