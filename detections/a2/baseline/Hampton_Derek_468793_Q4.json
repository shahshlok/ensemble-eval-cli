The expression (max_rows != 0 || max_rows == 0) is a tautology: for any integer value, either it is zero or it is not zero, so the condition is always true. This indicates a gap in understanding of boolean operators and logical relationships: the student is treating the if-statement as a required wrapper around the loop, rather than reasoning about whether the condition changes program behavior.
