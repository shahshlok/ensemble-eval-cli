For a nested-loop pattern, the outer loop variable (currentRowNumber) should represent a fixed row number for the entire duration of that row, while the inner loop uses its own counter to control how many characters are printed on that row. By incrementing currentRowNumber inside the inner loop, the student breaks this separation of responsibilities: the outer loop counter changes unpredictably while it is still being used as the inner loop\u2019s bound, causing the inner loop\u2019s termination condition to never become false. The student appears to think of currentRowNumber as a general \"size\" that must be continuously adjusted while printing, rather than as a stable loop index whose updates are entirely controlled by the for-statement.",

Specifically, incrementing `currentRowNumber` inside the inner loop causes the outer loop to skip rows, leading to a drastically incorrect and much shorter triangle than expected, and may even lead to an infinite loop if the update condition is never met (though here it terminates early).

By incrementing currentRowNumber inside the inner loop, the student is confusing the roles of the two counters and disrupting the outer loop\u2019s control flow.
