          "conceptual_gap": "The student has a flawed mental model of variable assignment and arithmetic operations in Java. They don't recognize that `totalNumberOfGuesses++` or `totalNumberOfGuesses += 1` are the idiomatic and efficient ways to increment a variable. Instead, they decompose the operation into three separate steps (storing current value in `a`, storing 1 in `b`, adding them into `c`, then assigning back), which suggests a misunderstanding of how assignment and arithmetic work together in Java. While the code is functionally correct, it demonstrates a fundamental misconception about the elegance and directness of Java's operator syntax.",

          "conceptual_gap": "While the code is functionally correct because the loop ensures the final 'Correct!' message is only printed once outside the loop, the structure of the conditional block (`if`/`else if`) explicitly omits any handling for the successful guess condition (`userGuessValue == secretAnswerValue`). This shows the student treats the loop exit mechanism as the sole trigger for success, rather than potentially handling the success condition *within* the loop structure (e.g., `break` or an `else` block containing the print statement before the loop exit). The current structure forces comparison feedback only for incorrect inputs, which is efficient but suggests a dependency on the loop termination mechanism for all successful guess presentation.",
