          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that when the user guesses correctly and the 'Correct!' message is printed (inside the `else` block), the main program loop (`while`) is immediately terminated, or that the process of printing 'Correct!' somehow implicitly or explicitly fulfills the loop exit condition and stops processing subsequent code until the next iteration (which won't happen, ideally).",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student fails to fully account for the sequential nature of code execution within the loop body. When the correct guess is made, the program executes the `else` block, prints the success message, but then immediately reaches the end of the `while` block's iteration. Since the loop condition (`currentUserGuessValue != secretNumberAnswer`) will be checked *only* at the beginning of the next iteration, Python/Java execution doesn't terminate prematurely upon printing a success message inside the loop; it continues until the loop naturally completes. The student's code structure ensures that the loop completes after the correct guess's iteration, but the error lies in treating the correct guess (which should signal the end of the game) exactly like an incorrect guess where input is prompted again if the loop condition were still true.",
          "error_manifestation": "The program behaves correctly and terminates upon the correct guess. However, the logic structure used for the conditional branching is technically flawed for meeting the problem requirements, as it prints the success message BEFORE the loop condition is evaluated to false. If the logic demanded output *only* when the guess was wrong, this structure would be disastrous (but for this explicit game flow where the final correct guess is handled internally, it terminates correctly.)",
