The student did not realize that a successful guess should either use an explicit 'break' to avoid evaluating the rest of the loop block and prepare for immediate exit, or the success message should be printed outside a loop designed to check only for incorrect input.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student confuses conditional feedback within an iteration with conditional control flow (termination) of the loop. Specifically, the success condition (diff == 0) is met, the success output is printed, and then program execution continues to the end of the loop block before the loop condition (`userGuess != c`) is evaluated again. While this works, it violates the principle of immediate termination upon success in a sentinel loop structure, indicating a lack of understanding regarding flow management and the use of the `break` statement to control loop execution directly.",
