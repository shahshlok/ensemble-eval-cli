Here, `currentSum` is reset to 0 every time through the loop, so it only ever holds the current iteration's even value (or 0). Then `sum = currentSum;` replaces any previously accumulated value in `sum` with just this per-iteration value, discarding the running total. To maintain a running total, the accumulation must be done directly on `sum` (e.g., `sum += num;`) without reinitializing it inside the loop.",
