Furthermore, because the loop is infinite (due to the lack of input reading), the counter increases without bounds, not reflecting actual user interactions. If the code worked logically: a typical structure requires initialization `attempts = 0`, reading an initial guess, then entering a loop structure. The student initializes `attempts = 0` but increments it *before* reading the guess inside the (missing) loop structure, and never reads the first guess inside the counting logic.",
