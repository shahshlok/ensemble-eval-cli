They do not rely on the sequential execution property of the `if-else if` construct to implicitly enforce the upper boundary based on the failure of preceding, higher-value conditions.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In a strict `if / else if` structure, subsequent `else if` branches are only evaluated if all prior conditions were false. Therefore, when line 22 is reached, the flow guarantee already implies `grade < 90`. Checking `grade >= 80` would be sufficient for the 'B' grade, as the check `&& grade <= 89` is logically redundant. The student's mental model treats each condition as independent, ignoring the procedural filtering inherent in `else if` evaluation.",
