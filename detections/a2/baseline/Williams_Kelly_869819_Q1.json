This suggests they view the simultaneous use and update of a variable in a single statement (like `sum_even = sum_even + x;`) as potentially risky or impossible.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student does not fully grasp that Java evaluates the entire right-hand side of an assignment expression using the current values of all variables involved, and only then performs the assignment to the left-hand variable. The temporary variables `b` and `c` are entirely redundant, demonstrating a structural misunderstanding of how variable access and arithmetic precedence work during simple assignment operations. The intended operation is simply `sum_even += x;` or `sum_even = sum_even + x;`.",

The student is creating unnecessary variables (b and c) and reassigning values to them before performing the addition.

The student appears to think that variables must be 'prepared' or 'staged' before being used in calculations, rather than understanding that expressions can directly reference variables and combine them.",
