          "conceptual_gap": "The student misunderstands that loop evaluation occurs only before the execution of the loop body (or upon reaching the end of the body in a `do-while`, or using an explicit control flow statement like `break`). In this code, if the guess is correct (line 34), the conditional block prints the success message. Since there is no `break` statement, the program continues executing the remaining lines within the loop body (in this case, none) before checking the loop condition again at the top of the next iteration. However, the student's current logic structure means the `while` loop *will* terminate correctly on the subsequent check, but the issue is the redundant comparison step performed even when the condition for success has already been met.",
