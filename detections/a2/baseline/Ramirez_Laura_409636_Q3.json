          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that when using a series of 'else if' statements, defining the upper bound explicitly (e.g., `grade <= 89`) is unnecessary for every check, because the previous `if` statement failing ensures the grade is already below that preceding range's minimum (e.g., if 'A' fails, the grade must be less than 90). The student failed to define the lower bounds for the 'B', 'C', and 'D' checks, assuming the upper bound of the *next lowest* range would naturally be accounted for.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student correctly understands the sequential nature of `if-else if-else` structure (short-circuiting). However, they failed to recognize that even though the structure implies an upper boundary check (since previous conditions failed), an explicit lower boundary check is often required to correctly classify ranges, particularly when using boundary variables (like 80 for 'B', 70 for 'C', etc.). While the provided code *accidentally* works due to the specific definition of the ranges (e.g., if `grade >= 80` is true, we know `grade < 90` because the 'A' check failed), the thought process shows this logical redundancy/omission, which often leads to errors in more complex or overlapping range scenarios.",
