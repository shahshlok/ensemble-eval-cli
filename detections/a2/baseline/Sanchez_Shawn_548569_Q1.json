This suggests a highly rigid model where data must flow sequentially from one distinct, named container to the next.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student does not fully utilize the stability and reusability of declared variables in Java. `currentUserInputValue` could be used directly in the summation (L29). Creating `numberToAddToSum` is syntactically correct but functionally redundant, indicating a lack of understanding regarding efficient memory utilization and common coding practices for simple variable assignment.",
