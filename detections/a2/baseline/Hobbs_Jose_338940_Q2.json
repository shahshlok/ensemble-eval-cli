          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that the termination condition of the loop (`g != n`) handles the 'Correct!' output implicitly, and therefore the conditional checks (`if(g < n)` and `else if(g > n)`) should execute for every iteration, including the final successful guess.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In the actual Java execution model, when the loop condition `while(g!=n)` becomes false, the loop body stops executing *completely*. However, before termination, the final correct guess is processed inside the loop, where the subsequent `if/else if` statements also execute. Since the checks `g < n` and `g > n` are both false on the correct guess, no output is produced during that iteration, which is the desired behavior. The misconception is the logical structure of conditional branching: the student assumes that checks intended only for *wrong* guesses must be placed within explicit branches, potentially overlooking the fact that the correct guess naturally falls outside of those branches when using `if/else if` inside a loop that waits for equality.",
          "error_manifestation": "Correct output, but demonstrates a fragile logic structure. The code does not print 'Too high!' or 'Too low!' upon the correct guess because the structure `if(g<n) ... else if(g>n) ...` correctly leaves the case `g == n` silent.",
