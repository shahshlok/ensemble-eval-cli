          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, `null` and the empty string \"\" are different: `null` means the reference does not point to any object, while \"\" is a valid, non-null `String` object with length 0. Here the student explicitly initializes `letterGrade` to \"\" and then uses `if (letterGrade != null)` as if `null` were a possible 'uninitialized' or 'no value yet' state for this local variable. Given the clamping to [0,100] and the exhaustive if/else chain, `letterGrade` is always set to a non-empty string before the print, so the null check is both unnecessary and logically inconsistent with the initialization choice. This suggests a shaky mental model of how reference initialization and null checks work for local variables in Java.",
