This leads to two issues: (1) 60\u201364 are incorrectly classified as F because the outer condition has already restricted the range to 60\u2013100 before applying `grade >= 65`, and (2) grades below 60 are not handled at all, because there is no final `else` corresponding to the entire chain. The correct model is that each branch in the if\u2013else-if\u2013else chain must explicitly cover all remaining cases, and nested `if` statements do not magically provide a global final `else`.",
