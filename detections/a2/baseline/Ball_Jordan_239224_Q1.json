If the input stream contains non-integer data, that input token is consumed but does not count towards the total of 5 required iterations, causing the loop to continue indefinitely until five *valid* integers have been supplied.",
          "conceptual_gap": "For problems requiring a fixed total number of inputs (5), the loop counter should typically track the number of attempts or tokens processed. By coupling loop advancement exclusively to successful input validation (`scanner.hasNextInt()`), the student creates a program that can consume an unlimited number of invalid tokens, failing to terminate after processing 5 elements if bad data is interspersed, violating the fixed input constraint.",

          "conceptual_gap": "The student correctly uses `count` to track the number of inputs processed, but they only increment `count` inside the `if (scanner.hasNextInt())` block (L20). If `scanner.hasNextInt()` is false, the code enters the `else` block (L21), reads the invalid token (`scanner.next()`) (L22), and discards it, but `count` is never incremented in this case. This means if the user enters non-integer input, the loop continues indefinitely trying to read 5 *valid* integers, which violates the requirement to simply read 5 inputs (regardless of validity) and process only the even ones among them, or, if the goal is to read 5 integers, the loop structure is flawed because it doesn't limit the *total* number of tokens consumed to 5.",
          "error_manifestation": "If invalid input (non-integer tokens) is provided by the user, the program will consume more than 5 tokens and wait for 5 valid integers to satisfy the loop condition, or potentially hang if the input stream closes before 5 valid integers are given.",
