          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that the standard operational loop structure for processing input (read input, calculate/check, provide feedback) should include feedback for all branches defined by the comparison logic (less than, greater than) and that the absence of feedback implies the loop condition naturally terminates the loop when the precise condition (equality) is met, even if other code follows within the loop structure.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student has correctly identified the two cases requiring feedback (Too low, Too high) using `if/else if`. However, they failed to recognize the necessity of preventing the 'Too low!' or 'Too high!' feedback from executing immediately before the loop terminates when the guess is correct. Because the logic is structured as `if (low) { print } else if (high) { print } else { // correct case }`, the loop condition `while (userGuess != answer)` is the only thing stopping the loop from repeating. But the code *inside* the loop (lines 20-23) still executes even if the guess on line 18 was correct, resulting in unnecessary, misleading, or incorrect output if the logic isn't structured to exclusively handle the incorrect cases within the loop body.",
          "error_manifestation": "Wrong output / Misleading output. If the number is guessed correctly, the program proceeds past the if/else if block because neither condition (userGuess < answer or userGuess > answer) is met, correctly skipping the 'Too high/Too low' messages. However, the logic reveals a potential failure to structure input/check/feedback/exit sequence correctly. While the student's current code works because `else` is implicitly the correct answer, the structure shows a lack of awareness regarding where control flow should *exit* or *break* the sequence of operations within the loop body when success is achieved, which is typical of a common CS1 error related to loop termination conditions versus internal logic checks.",
