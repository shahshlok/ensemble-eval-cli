          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that when using an if-else if structure to check overlapping ranges (like grade thresholds), each condition needs to explicitly define both the lower and upper bounds, or they implicitly assume that subsequent else-if checks require full range checks even though the previous conditions already handled the higher end of the scale.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In a correctly structured `if-else if` ladder checking numeric thresholds from highest to lowest, subsequent `else if` conditions only need to check the lower bound because the `if` and preceding `else if` branches implicitly define the effective upper bound. For example, if `grade >= 90` is false, the code proceeds to `else if (grade >= 80)`. Since we know `grade` is already less than 90, this only checks the range [80-89]. The student's code, except for the 'A' grade check, explicitly omits the necessary upper bounds (e.g., `grade <= 89`) in the logic, which is only acceptable *if* they rely on the sequential nature of the `if-else if` structure, which they correctly did, but their explicit use of `grade <= 100` for 'A' suggests they might not fully trust or understand the sequential exclusion principle.",
          "error_manifestation": "No functional error in this specific implementation due to the correct ordering (high to low), but the explicit check for `grade <= 100` in the first condition is redundant and suggests incomplete understanding of efficient range checking in sequential conditional structures.",
