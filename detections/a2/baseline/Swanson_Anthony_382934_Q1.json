The student may think that directly writing sum_even = sum_even + x would cause an error or not work correctly.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, a variable can be directly updated with an expression that references itself on the right-hand side. The statement `sum_even = sum_even + x` (or `sum_even += x`) is valid and idiomatic. The student's mental model suggests they don't fully understand that the right-hand side is evaluated first using the current value, then assigned to the left-hand side variable. This reveals uncertainty about the assignment operator's semantics.",

They seem to avoid or misunderstand the direct use of the compound addition assignment operator (`+=`) or the direct arithmetic expression (`sum_even = sum_even + x`).",
