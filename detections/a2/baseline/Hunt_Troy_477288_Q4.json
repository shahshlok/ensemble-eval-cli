They likely think that as `i` grows, the condition `j <= i` will eventually become false for the current line, even though `j` is never changed.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, each `while` loop continues until its own condition becomes false, and that condition only changes when the variables it depends on are updated correctly. Here, the inner loop condition is `j <= i`, but only `i` is incremented; `j` is never modified. Because `j` starts at 1 and `i` only increases (1, 2, 3, ...), the condition `j <= i` remains true forever, so the inner loop never terminates. The student appears to misunderstand that the inner loop must update `j` (its own control variable) to eventually break out, and that changing the outer loop variable `i` does not, by itself, make the inner loop stop. As a result, the program does not produce the triangle shape at all and instead gets stuck printing asterisks indefinitely.",
