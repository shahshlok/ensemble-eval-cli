          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that the `while (guess != answer)` loop condition will check the value of `guess` only *after* the comparison code (the `if/else if` block) executes, automatically excluding the correct 'guess' from processing inside the loop body, and thus preventing the 'Too high'/'Too low' messages from being printed when the user finally guesses correctly.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The `while` loop condition is evaluated *before* the loop body executes. When the user guesses the correct number, the loop body runs one last time because the check `(guess != answer)` was performed based on the *previous* value of `guess`. Inside this final loop iteration, the `if/else if` statements (lines 14-18) correctly evaluate to false, meaning no feedback is printed for the correct guess. The loop then terminates before the *next* iteration. The conceptual gap is the misunderstanding of control flow: the student fails to account for the fact that the correct guess is processed *inside* the loop, but since they only print feedback for incorrect guesses, the control flow is actually correct, although perhaps inefficient.",
          "error_manifestation": "None. The code is logically correct and produces the desired output, although the structure (checking the condition based on the initial `guess=0` and then based on user input immediately preceding the loop check) is common in CS1 but does not represent a true misconception here, as the logic correctly handles the exit condition without double-printing or missing the final output.",
