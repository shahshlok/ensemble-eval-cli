          "conceptual_gap": "In an `if-else if` ladder, if an `else if` block is reached, Java guarantees that all preceding conditions evaluated to false. Therefore, the upper bound checking (`grade < 90` in the case of 'B') is redundant since the structure already ensures the grade is less than 90 (or it would have been caught by the 'A' condition). While the code is *logically* correct, the inclusion of redundant bounds suggests the student has not fully grasped how the sequential and exclusive nature of `if-else if` structures controls program flow.",
