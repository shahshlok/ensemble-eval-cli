          "conceptual_gap": "The student fails to recognize that the standard `if/else if` control flow structure is designed to handle ranges directly and robustly on the original variable (e.g., `if (n >= 90)`). The chosen method, relying on integer division to create a category index, is unnecessarily brittle, only working correctly because the specified grade boundaries (60, 70, 80, 90) happen to be perfect multiples of 10. This shortcut demonstrates a misunderstanding of how to build general and robust conditional logic for grade or interval checking.",

          "conceptual_gap": "The student failed to account for the maximal score of 100. When input is 100, integer division `100/10` yields `10`. The subsequent conditional logic uses checks only up to `a >= 9`. Since `10 >= 9` is true, the grade 'A' is correctly assigned. However, the use of integer division is an unnecessarily complex and potentially fragile way to handle range checks, although in this specific student implementation (using cascading `else if` for the minimum required value), it covers all valid inputs (0-100) correctly, *except* for the case of 100, which results in `a=10`. If they had used `if (a == 9)`, 100 would fail. Since they used `a >= 9`, 100 works. The primary logical flaw is the failure to handle inputs outside the specified range (0-100, if not prohibited by the problem prompt). Since the problem specifies 0-100, and the implementation handles 100 correctly (`100/10=10`, `10>=9` -> 'A'), there is no logical error for valid inputs (0-100).",
