They assume a valid case must be verified.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java (and most sane programming languages), the length of a String is fundamentally defined as a non-negative integer (zero or greater). The control structure `if (s.length() >= 0)` is always true and provides no actual defensive value, suggesting the student is unaware of the guaranteed non-negative nature of the String length property.",

          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, the `length()` method of a String always returns a non-negative integer (0 or positive). The condition `s.length() >= 0` is always true for any string object, including an empty string. This suggests the student may not understand that string length is a fundamental property that cannot violate this constraint, or they may be confusing this with array bounds checking or other validation patterns.",
          "error_manifestation": "While this doesn't cause incorrect output in this specific case (the code still works and produces the correct triangle), it represents a logic error that suggests a flawed mental model. The condition serves no purpose and will never filter out any strings. In a different context, such a misconception could lead to more serious bugs.",
