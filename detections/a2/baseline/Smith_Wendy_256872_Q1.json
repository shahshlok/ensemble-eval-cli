The correct mental model is that an accumulator for a running total must (1) be declared outside the loop so it persists across iterations, and (2) be updated by adding the new contribution to its existing value (e.g., finalSumOfEvenNumbers += currentUserInputValue) rather than replaced by a fresh per-iteration value.",
