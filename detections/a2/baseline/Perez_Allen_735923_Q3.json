They assume the input domain is perfectly covered.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student does not fully grasp how flow control handles inputs outside the expected domain [0, 100]. By strictly enforcing `numericGradeValue <= 100` in the first condition, they ensure scores above 100 fail that check. Since subsequent checks also fail (as 105 is not <= 89, 79, or 69), inputs greater than 100 fall through the entire `if-else if` cascade and erroneously receive the 'F' grade assigned in the final `else` block.",

          "conceptual_gap": "The student fails to utilize the cascading nature of the `else if` structure. When execution reaches an `else if`, it is guaranteed that all previous `if` and `else if` conditions were false. For example, in Step 6 (`numericGradeValue >= 80 && numericGradeValue <= 89`), the `numericGradeValue` is already guaranteed to be less than 90 because the Step 5 condition failed. Therefore, checking `numericGradeValue <= 89` is logically redundant and indicates a lack of understanding regarding how sequential/cascading selection structures optimize range checks.",
