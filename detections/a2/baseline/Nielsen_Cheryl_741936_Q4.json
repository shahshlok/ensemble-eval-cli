They seem to think that changing `a` in the body of the inner loop directly and cleanly controls the number of rows and how the pattern grows in subsequent iterations.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, a `for` loop has a well-defined control flow: (1) initialize, (2) check condition, (3) execute body, (4) execute the increment expression, then repeat from step (2). For `for (int a = 1; a <= userInputHeight; a++)`, Java will always execute `a++` after each iteration of the outer loop body, regardless of any assignments to `a` inside that body. By assigning `a = 0` inside the inner loop, the student simultaneously disrupts the inner loop condition (`b <= a`) and the outer loop progression, leading to unintended behavior (the outer loop repeatedly returning to `a = 1`). The mental model error is thinking that manually changing the loop variable is the correct way to influence future loop iterations, rather than understanding that the loop header controls iteration and should not be overridden from within. They also miss that this causes the outer loop to never reach `a = 2, 3, ..., N`, so the triangle cannot grow as required.",

The student appears to think that this assignment only influences what happens after the current row finishes, but in reality it also affects the remaining iterations of the inner loop and the subsequent outer-loop iterations. Specifically, setting `a` to 0 causes the inner loop to terminate early and then the outer loop\u2019s `a++` turns `a` back into 1 every time, so the outer loop condition is always true and the loop never progresses past the first row.
