          "conceptual_gap": "The student fails to recognize the deterministic guarantees of the preceding structured control flow. Since the outer loop only runs when `i >= 1` and the inner loop runs exactly `i` times, the string `y` is guaranteed to have a length `i >= 1` at line 16. The conditional check `if (y.length() >= 0)` is mathematically trivial and redundant, suggesting a flawed mental model regarding runtime state guarantees established by iterative constructs.",
