This suggests a rigid mental model where control flow parameters must be 'insultated' or pre-calculated separately.",

The student's practice of creating variables like `a`, `b`, `c`, `row_count`, `j_start`, and `j_end` merely to copy existing values or perform trivial calculations (c = N) indicates a misunderstanding of how flexibly control flow variables can be defined and used, leading to unnecessary complexity and memory overhead.",

The student computes c = b - a + 1 = N - 1 + 1 = N, which equals b, making the entire setup redundant. In actual Java execution, these variables consume memory and add cognitive overhead without advancing the algorithm.

In actual Java execution, these are just aliases that consume extra memory and execution cycles. The inner loop `for(int j = j_start; j <= j_end; j++)` could simply be `for(int j = 1; j <= i; j++)`, making the intent immediate and clear.",
