If a grade is 59 or less, all explicit conditions (`>= 90`, `>= 80`, `>= 70`, `>= 60`) evaluate to false, and the control flow skips the entire structure entirely, producing no output.

          "conceptual_gap": "The student has used nested conditionals to enforce a custom grading scheme that conflicts with the external problem specification. The Java execution model strictly enforces the conditions written (60-64 yields F), regardless of whether the resulting output is logically incorrect based on the problem description (60-64 should yield D).
