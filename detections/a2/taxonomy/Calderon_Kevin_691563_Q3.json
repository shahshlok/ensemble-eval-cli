Here, the student writes a nested `if` under `else if (grade_value >= 60)` without braces, producing two separate `if` statements: (1) the outer `else if (grade_value >= 60)` that controls whether we even enter the inner section, and (2) the inner `if (grade_value >= 65)` with its `else`. As a result, grades below 60 do not execute the inner `else` at all (no output), and the effective ranges are not what the student likely imagines.
