          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that when invalid input is encountered, consuming it with `scanner.next()` and then continuing the loop will naturally prompt the user again and allow them to enter valid input on the next iteration.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student has not recognized that after consuming invalid input with `scanner.next()`, the loop immediately continues without re-prompting. The prompt only appears when the loop condition is checked and the loop body executes again. Additionally, the `guessCount` is only incremented for valid integer input, so invalid inputs don't count toward the total. More critically, the loop will continue indefinitely on invalid input without ever incrementing `guessCount` or advancing the game state, creating an infinite loop of re-prompts without progress.",
          "error_manifestation": "When the user enters non-integer input (e.g., 'abc'), the program consumes that input and re-prompts, but never advances. This creates a confusing user experience where the game appears stuck. The user must keep entering invalid input to see the prompt again.",

When `scanner.hasNextInt()` is false, the code consumes only one token with `scanner.next()`. If the user enters multiple invalid tokens on one line (e.g., 'abc def'), only one token is consumed per loop iteration. The student does not realize that the remaining tokens stay in the input buffer, requiring multiple iterations to clear them all.",
