          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that when using an `if-else if` structure, every conditional branch must explicitly define both the upper and lower boundaries of the required range (e.g., `grade >= 80 && grade <= 89`), regardless of the previously failed conditions. The student does not trust the sequential execution of the `else if` structure to implicitly enforce the upper boundary.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The Java `if-else if` structure is mutually exclusive. By the time the execution flow reaches an `else if` branch, the conditions of all preceding `if` and `else if` branches must have been false. For numerical ranges, this means the upper boundary check is already performed by the previous failed condition. Requiring both bounds in every `else if` block, as seen here, indicates a failure to fully conceptualize sequential control flow and how program state is constrained by failed checks.",
