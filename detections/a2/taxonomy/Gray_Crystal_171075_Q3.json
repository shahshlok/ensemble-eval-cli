Using independent `if` blocks ensures that the Boolean operations for lines 13 through 16 are unnecessarily executed even if the grade was already determined (e.g., if `y` was 95, all subsequent checks are still performed, wasting clock cycles). The Java execution model allows for rapid branching via `else if` to skip irrelevant checks, a mechanism the student has ignored.",

          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, a sequence of independent `if` statements (without `else if` or `else`) means every condition is evaluated, and its corresponding block is executed if true. While the conditions `(y>=90 && y<=100)`, `(y<90 && y>=80)`, etc., are mutually exclusive for a single input, the sheer verbosity and reliance on the structure of the conditions to prevent multiple assignments indicates a lack of knowledge regarding efficient branching control flow mechanisms (`if-else if`).
