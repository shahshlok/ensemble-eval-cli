Within that range, checking if (grade >= 65) correctly splits D (65-89) from F (60-64), but this logic is backwards for the actual requirement. The specification states D should be 60-69 and F below 60. The student's code will produce:\n- Grades 60-64: F (correct by accident)\n- Grades 65-69: D (correct)\n- But grades 70-79 go to C, 80-89 go to B, 90-100 go to A\n\nHowever, the real issue is that the nested structure is unnecessarily complex and error-prone.

Line 12 creates `safe_grade` to clamp the input, and then line 16 creates `grade = safe_grade`. This extra assignment serves no purpose - `grade` could directly reference the clamped value or the clamping logic could operate directly on `grade`.

They confuse the requirements for the 'D' and 'F' grades (D is 60-69, F is < 60) with an internal requirement to split the D range based on 65, and fail to realize that the 'F' grade is already covered by the failure of the initial `if/else if` ladder, not by falling through the 60-69 range.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The assignment specifies F for 'below 60'. Since the entire if-else if ladder only checks grades >= 60 (A, B, C), any grade less than 60 would automatically fall through to the final implicit 'else' if the D grade check (60-69) had been structured correctly. Instead, the student introduces complex nested logic (lines 30-34) only triggered for grades 60-69, intending to assign 'D' if >= 65 and 'F' if < 65. If a grade of 62 is entered, the logic executes Line 30, fails Line 31, and prints 'F' (Line 34), which violates the requirement that 60-69 yields 'D'. Furthermore, this structure attempts to handle the 'F' grade (< 60) inside a block that logically requires `grade >= 60` to even execute. The conceptual gap is a misunderstanding of how conditional ranges are evaluated and the structure required to satisfy mutually exclusive ranges based on defined cutoffs.",
