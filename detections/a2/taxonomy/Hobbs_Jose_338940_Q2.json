When `g` equals `n`, the loop terminates *immediately* before the conditional checks (`if/else if`) inside the loop can execute. This means the program never prints the 'Correct!' message until after the loop, which is correct, but the use of the conditional statements (`if/else if`) fails to account for the successful guess state inside the loop.",
