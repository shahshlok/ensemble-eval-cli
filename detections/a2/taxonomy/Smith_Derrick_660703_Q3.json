          "conceptual_gap": "The student fails to utilize the implicit conditional filtering provided by the Java `else if` control flow structure. The actual Java execution model ensures that the current `else if` condition is only reached if all preceding conditions were false. Therefore, the upper bound checks (e.g., `<= 89` in the B grade calculation) are logically guaranteed by the failure of the prior checks (e.g., `>= 90`), making them redundant. This suggests a weak mental model of procedural control flow dependency.",
