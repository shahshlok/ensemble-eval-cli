          "conceptual_gap": "The student struggles to structure activity-controlled loops where the check follows the action (post-test or `do-while` style). By choosing a pre-test `while` loop, they are forced to synthesize a placeholder value (`a=0`) which represents no meaningful state in the game, only serving to bypass the initial condition check. This demonstrates a preference for loop priming over using alternative iteration constructs like `do-while` loops, suggesting a limited mental model of iteration control flow based on the execution order (check-then-execute model).",
