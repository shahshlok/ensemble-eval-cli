While defensive programming is good, using `hasNextInt()` followed by setting a temporary variable and THEN assigning it to `userGuessValue` (lines 28-31) suggests the student doesn't trust the simple assignment or is unfamiliar with direct variable assignment during input reading (e.g., `userGuessValue = userInputScanner.nextInt();`). Furthermore, the handling of invalid input (lines 33-37) consumes the invalid token but fails to set `userGuessValue` to a safe state, relying on `continue` to proceed, which is poor form, but doesn't fundamentally break execution flow here, mainly demonstrating a conceptual over-engineering of the simple read operation.",
