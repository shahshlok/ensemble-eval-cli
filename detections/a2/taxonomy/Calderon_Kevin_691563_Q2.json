          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that printing the 'Correct!' message is necessary immediately after a successful guess inside the loop, even though the loop condition (`while (userGuess != answer)`) guarantees that the loop will terminate immediately afterward. They treat the `else` block (L21-L23) as the definitive output for a correct guess, failing to recognize that the loop's termination mechanism handles the 'correct' transition.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The Java execution model requires that control flow reaches the end of the loop body before re-evaluating the `while` condition. The student correctly identifies the winning condition (L21) and prints the success message (L22). While this code works, it represents a redundant architectural choice. They placed termination handling logic (the success message) inside the loop's conditional body, instead of allowing the loop (which is a pre-test loop) to terminate first, and then printing the success message outside the loop structure. This redundancy suggests a lack of trust in or understanding of how `while` loop termination controls succeeding program flow.",
          "error_manifestation": "None. The code is logically sound and produces the correct output, but it exhibits redundant control flow structure, which often signals a fragile or slightly incorrect mental model of loop termination logic.",
