They likely think of the condition more as a mathematical statement of all possibilities than as a runtime filter that can be true or false on each execution.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, an if-statement is only useful when its boolean condition can sometimes be true and sometimes be false; it is evaluated at runtime to decide whether to execute its body. The condition `safeN != 0 || safeN == 0` is a tautology that is always true, so the if-statement never blocks execution and is effectively dead code around the loop. Similarly, `if (col != 0)` is always true immediately after `int col = 1;`. The student appears not to reason about the actual runtime values and truth of these expressions, and instead treats conditions as a way to symbolically enumerate or \"cover\" all logical cases, rather than understanding that the loop alone (`while (row <= safeN)` and `while (col <= row)`) already correctly handles zero and non-zero values without extra guards.",
