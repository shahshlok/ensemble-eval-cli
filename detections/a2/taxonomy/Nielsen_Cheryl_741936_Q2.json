Java supports direct increment operations (`totalNumberOfGuesses = totalNumberOfGuesses + 1;` or, preferably, `totalNumberOfGuesses++;`) which implicitly handle the sequence of reading, calculating, and writing in a single, idiomatic statement. The student's model forces artificial complexity onto a simple atomic operation, indicating a reluctance or failure to grasp compound assignment and increment syntax.",
