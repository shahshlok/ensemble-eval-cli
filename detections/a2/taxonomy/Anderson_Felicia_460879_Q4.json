They think: a=1, b=N, then c = b - a + 1 gives the 'count' of iterations, and using c as the upper bound is the proper way to loop.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student doesn't recognize that for a simple counting loop from 1 to N, the loop condition can directly use N without intermediate calculation. The expression 'c = b - a + 1' computes N+1 (since b=N, a=1, so N-1+1=N), but this obfuscates the intent. More critically, the student may believe this intermediate computation is necessary for correctness, when a direct loop from 1 to N would be clearer. This suggests a misconception about loop mechanics\u2014the student over-engineers the solution.",
