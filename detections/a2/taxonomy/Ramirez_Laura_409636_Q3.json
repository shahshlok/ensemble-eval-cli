          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that since the problem defined the input range as 0-100, they must explicitly enforce an upper boundary check (`<= 100`) even for the highest grade category ('A'). This demonstrates a belief that every range must be tightly bound by two explicit conditions, regardless of the cascading nature of the conditional logic or standard grading practices where scores above 100 usually still yield the highest grade.",
          "conceptual_gap": "When defining the highest possible category (A, or 90+), Java conditionals should generally only check the lower bound (`grade >= 90`), relying on the definition of the scale to cover all sufficiently high values. By explicitly enforcing `grade <= 100`, the student causes scores higher than 100 (if input validation fails) to fall through incorrectly to the next conditional block (Grade B) instead of being assigned Grade A. The correct logic, given the use of `else if`, for grade >= 90 should be simply `grade >= a` (assuming the highest possible grade is intended to be A).",
          "error_manifestation": "Wrong output: Inputs slightly greater than 100 (e.g., 105) will incorrectly result in 'B' instead of 'A' (or triggering input validation, which is missing).",
