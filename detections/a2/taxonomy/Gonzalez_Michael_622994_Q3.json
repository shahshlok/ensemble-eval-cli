They do not trust or fully utilize the mutual exclusivity provided by the 'else if' structure.",
          "conceptual_gap": "Java's 'if-else if' construct is sequential and exclusive. By the time the execution reaches an 'else if' block, all preceding conditions are guaranteed to be false. Therefore, checking the upper boundary is redundant because the failure of the previous, higher-grade condition already establishes the necessary upper limit for the current grade range.",
