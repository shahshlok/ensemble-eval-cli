          "conceptual_gap": "The Java `if-else if` structure guarantees that if a condition is reached, all preceding conditions were false. For instance, upon reaching the check for a 'B' grade (>= 80), the code implicitly confirms the grade is less than 90 (or 90+ was already handled). Explicitly checking `&& grade <= 89` is redundant and suggests the student views the conditions as potentially overlapping, like independent `if` statements.",
