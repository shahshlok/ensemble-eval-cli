          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, uninitialized local variables are compile errors if used, but declaring and initializing them when they are never subsequently utilized merely adds dead code and complexity. The student declares `i=1, j=1, a, b, c` but only uses `n`, `a`, and `b`. This suggests a poor understanding of program hygiene and variable lifecycle management.",
