Since `i` starts at 1, any execution of the code block within the outer loop means `i` (and thus `y`) is guaranteed to be 1 or greater. The explicit `if (y != 0)` check is logically redundant and shows a lack of trust in the established control flow invariants.",

They also unnecessarily check if input is an integer before reading it, indicating a fear of invalid input causing a crash, even though `Scanner.nextInt()` handles non-integer input by throwing an exception, which this defensive code doesn't fully prevent error handling but rather just avoids crashing for non-integer input by setting n=0.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student introduces unnecessary conditional guards for variable states that are guaranteed by established program flow (e.g., `i` being a positive counter), suggesting a lack of trust in or understanding of loop invariant properties. Additionally, the fragmented input handling (`hasNextInt()` followed by `nextInt()`) and clamping of negative height (`if (n < 0) n = 0;`) suggests confusion about how input validation and control flow relate to variable safety.",
