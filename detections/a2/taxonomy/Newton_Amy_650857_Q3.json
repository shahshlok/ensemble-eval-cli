          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that each range in an 'if/else if' chain must be defined with explicit lower and upper bounds (e.g., 80 to 89), treating each conditional block as an independent check rather than a sequential, mutually exclusive decision based on previous failures.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The Java execution model guarantees that an 'else if' condition is only evaluated if the preceding 'if' or 'else if' conditions were false. For instance, to reach the 'B' grade check (line 25), the grade must already be confirmed as less than 90 (the failure condition of the 'A' grade check). Therefore, the upper bound constraint (e.g., `&& numericGradeValue <= 89`) is logically redundant and indicates a failure to internalize the sequential, cascading nature of the conditional structure.",
