They expect the loop to terminate immediately upon the correct guess, and then the 'else' block, which is the final check within the loop's structure, will provide the concluding output.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student fails to realize that the body of the `while` loop executes completely for *every* iteration, including the final one where the guess is correct. When `userGuess == secretNumber`, the `if` and `else if` conditions (Too low/Too high) are skipped, and the successful outcome message in the final `else` is executed *before* the loop condition is re-evaluated and found to be false (terminating the loop). This causes the correct message to be printed while still inside the controlled flow of the loop.",
          "error_manifestation": "None. This code correctly solves the problem, but the inclusion of the final success output inside the loop's conditional structure (lines 20-22) is logically unusual for a loop that is controlled by the exact condition it reports on. A more common and clearer approach is to let the loop terminate silently and print the success message immediately after the loop.",

          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, variables must be initialized before use. The student initializes `userGuess` to 0 (Line 11). Since the `secretNumber` is guaranteed to be between 1 and 100, `userGuess != secretNumber` is guaranteed to be true on the first check of the `while` loop (Line 14). This wastes no input and seems harmless, even though the initialization value (0) is outside the bounds of the valid game guesses (1-100). However, the intention of initializing `userGuess = 0` is not to represent a valid guess, but merely to satisfy the compiler and ensure the loop runs at least once. This reflects a lack of understanding that the variable used in the loop condition (`userGuess`) needs a meaningful initial value *only* if the loop might exit immediately or if the logic flow depends on that initial value being sensible.",

They fail to recognize that if the `while` loop condition is responsible for continuous iteration, the outcome that breaks that condition must be handled independently of the loop structure, or handled explicitly *before* the loop condition is re-evaluated.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student successfully handles the termination logic *within* the loop (Lines 22-23). This is correct for the logic structure they chose. However, frequently, students who use a `while(condition)` structure for iteration (especially `while(true)` or `do-while`) prefer to wait until *after* the loop to print the final result. By embedding the `System.out.println(\"Correct...\")` statement inside the loop, and relying on it to execute immediately before the loop naturally terminates, the student risks duplicating logic or creating brittle code if the loop structure were slightly different (e.g., if the loop was exited via a `break` before the final `else` block was reached). In this code, it works, but reflects a mechanical mapping of requirements ('print Correct!') into the `else` branch of the input check, without considering the control flow implication that this print statement is the final action before exiting the loop.",
