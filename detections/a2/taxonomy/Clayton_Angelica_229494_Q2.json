          "conceptual_gap": "The student fails to utilize the logical deduction inherent in an 'if/else' structure. When execution reaches line 23, the system knows that 'guess' is not equal to 'answer' (from line 19) AND 'guess' is not greater than 'answer' (from line 23). Therefore, 'guess < answer' is the only remaining possibility. The subsequent explicit check 'if (guess < answer)' is redundant, and the final 'else' block (lines 27-29) is logically unreachable, revealing a misunderstanding of how control flow guarantees mutually exclusive constraints.",
