          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, a variable is merely a memory location whose value can be overwritten immediately. Since the calculation result (`n % 2`) is used only once in the subsequent `if` statement, only one local temporary variable (or none, by calculating the modulo directly in the `if` condition) is necessary. Allocating and cycling through three separate variables (`a`, `b`, `c`) for this purpose demonstrates a flawed understanding of variable lifespan and efficiency.",

          "conceptual_gap": "The Java execution model allows for indefinite declaration of local variables within a scope, and the student's reuse of `a` and `b` (lines 35 and 43) is unnecessary and potentially confusing. The student seems constrained by an arbitrary belief about variable management, rather than understanding that new temporary variables can be declared for each iteration's modulo check, or, more properly, that the modulo result should be used directly or stored in a descriptively named variable (like `isEven`). Runtime correctness is maintained here only because the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are reused in sequence and do not interact between checks.",
