They may think the loop \"knows\" to count iterations for `star` because the condition uses `star <= row`, even if `star` itself is never incremented.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, a for-loop executes by repeatedly: (1) evaluating the condition, (2) running the body if the condition is true, and (3) executing exactly the update expression in the third clause. The loop does not automatically increment the variable used in the condition; the programmer must explicitly update the correct loop counter. Here, the inner loop condition depends on `star` (`star <= row`), but the update expression increments `row` instead of `star`. As a result, `star` stays at 1 forever while `row` keeps increasing, so the condition `star <= row` never becomes false. The student\u2019s mental model misses the tight coupling between the loop\u2019s termination condition and the variable updated in the third clause, especially in the presence of nested loops where changing `row` in the inner loop also affects the outer loop.",

The inner loop becomes an infinite loop (or exits prematurely depending on the condition), because `star` never changes\u2014it's always compared to the current value of `row`, which keeps growing.
