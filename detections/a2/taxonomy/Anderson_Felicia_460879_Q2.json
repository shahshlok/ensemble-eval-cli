          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, rand.nextInt(n) generates a number from 0 to n-1 (not 0 to n). Therefore, rand.nextInt(100) generates 0-99, and adding 1 gives 1-100, which is correct. However, the student's variable naming and setup (a=100, b=1, then rand.nextInt(a) + b) suggests they may not fully understand that nextInt() takes the upper bound as an exclusive parameter. While the code happens to work correctly, the variable assignments show unclear reasoning about the range calculation.",
          "error_manifestation": "The code actually produces correct output by coincidence (1-100 range works), but the student's mental model of how nextInt() works is fragile and could lead to errors if they change the range parameters.",

The line `int answer = c;` is redundant\u2014the student could have simply used `int answer = rand.nextInt(a) + b;` directly.
