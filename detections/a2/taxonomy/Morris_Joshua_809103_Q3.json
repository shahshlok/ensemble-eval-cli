          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that in a series of `if-else if` statements, each condition must independently check both the lower and upper bounds of its desired range using logical AND (`&&`). The student does not rely on the `else` keyword to implicitly enforce the upper limit failure of the preceding conditional checks.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The purpose of the `else if` structure is to ensure sequential evaluation, where execution only proceeds to the next condition if all previous conditions failed. For instance, reaching line 24 guarantees that `numericGradeValue` is already less than 90. Therefore, checking `numericGradeValue <= 89` is logically redundant and reveals incomplete trust in, or understanding of, the control flow mechanism.",
