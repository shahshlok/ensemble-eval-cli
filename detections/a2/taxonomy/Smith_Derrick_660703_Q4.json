Using `< c` with a starting value of `1` will only iterate while `row_index` is strictly less than `c`, stopping before `c` itself. With `a = 1` and `c = N`, a loop of the form `for (int row_index = a; row_index < c; row_index++)` will execute for `row_index = 1, 2, ..., N-1`, not for `N`. To include `N`, the condition must be `row_index <= N` (or the loop must be reparameterized correctly). The student appears to be treating the bound computation `b - a + 1` and the `<` condition algebraically, rather than reasoning about the actual step-by-step evaluation of the loop condition.",
