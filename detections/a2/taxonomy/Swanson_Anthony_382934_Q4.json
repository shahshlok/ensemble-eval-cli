In other words, they treat c as both the count of rows and the last row index, implicitly assuming the loop condition behaves like an inclusive upper bound.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, a for-loop with condition row < c will execute only while row is strictly less than c, so if row starts at 1 it will visit 1, 2, ..., c-1. To run for c iterations starting from 1, the condition must allow row to reach c (e.g., row <= c) or the loop must start at 0 and run while row < c. The student's introduction of a, b, and c suggests they are thinking in terms of an inclusive mathematical interval [a, b] and translating it incorrectly to Java's half-open loop condition, leading to an off-by-one error and one fewer row than required.",
