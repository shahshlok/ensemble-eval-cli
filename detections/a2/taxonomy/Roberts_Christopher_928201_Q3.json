          "conceptual_gap": "The student is using named integer variables (`a`, `b`, `c`, `d`) to store fixed, constant values (90, 80, 70, 60) which are immediately used in sequential comparisons. This adds unnecessary steps and memory overhead, though it does not technically break the program logic. The Java execution model allows direct use of literal constants in comparison operations (e.g., `if (grade >= 90)`). This indicates a lack of understanding about the efficiency and standard practices of using constants versus temporary variables for fixed thresholds.",
