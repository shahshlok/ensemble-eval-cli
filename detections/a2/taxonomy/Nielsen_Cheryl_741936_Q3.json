The student fails to recognize that by the time an `else if` block is reached, the flow control structure has already enforced the necessary upper bound constraint.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The actual Java execution model for `if-else if` proceeds sequentially. If code execution reaches an `else if` block, it is guaranteed that all preceding `if` and `else if` conditions evaluated to false. This structure inherently establishes an upper bound (e.g., if the 'A' condition failed, the grade must be < 90). The student's flawed mental model neglects this state constraint provided by the control flow, leading to logically redundant checks (such as `&& numericGradeValue <= 89`).",
          "error_manifestation": "Logically redundant and inefficient code. The program produces correct output but unnecessarily checks conditions that are guaranteed to be true or false based on prior execution state.",

          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that by storing the grade boundaries (90, 80, 70, 60) in variables and using them in comparisons, they have correctly implemented the grading logic. They treat each condition as an independent check of the form 'grade >= boundary AND grade <= upper_limit', not recognizing that the upper limits should be derived from the previous boundary minus 1, or that the conditions are redundant when structured sequentially.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student fails to recognize that in a sequential if-else chain, once a condition is false, all previous ranges are already eliminated. Therefore, checking 'numericGradeValue <= 89' in the B condition is redundant because we've already verified it's not >= 90. More critically, the student doesn't understand that the upper bounds (100, 89, 79, 69) are hardcoded magic numbers rather than being derived from the logical structure of the ranges. This suggests the student is thinking of each condition as a standalone validation rather than as a partition of the input space.",
          "error_manifestation": "The code actually produces correct output for the given sample run (85 \u2192 B) because the hardcoded values happen to align with the problem specification. However, this is brittle logic that masks the misconception. The code would fail if the grading scale were modified, and it shows the student doesn't understand the semantic relationship between consecutive ranges.",
