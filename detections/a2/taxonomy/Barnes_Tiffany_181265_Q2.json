          "conceptual_gap": "The student has included the successful outcome (printing 'Correct!...') *outside* the `while` loop, which is correct. However, within the loop, the student failed to handle the output for the correct guess case (`diff == 0`). Execution enters the empty `if (diff == 0)` block, does nothing, and the loop terminates correctly, but the user is never informed that the current guess was correct until the final outside-the-loop print statement combines the 'Correct!' message with the guess count. The conceptual gap is treating the loop termination condition (`userGuess != secretNumber`) as sufficient to convey the 'Correct!' status *during* the final successful iteration, rather than using an explicit `if/else` *inside* the loop for all feedback *except* the final summary.",
