          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, assigning a value to a variable that is never used has no effect on program execution. The student appears to think that computing this value (which equals 1 + 4 - 1 = 4 in the sample) might be necessary for the loop or output, but the actual loop logic depends only on variables `i` and `N`. The variable `c` is dead code.",
          "error_manifestation": "No runtime error or wrong output occurs, but the code contains unnecessary computation. This suggests the student may have been uncertain about the loop logic and added extraneous calculations.",

          "conceptual_gap": "The student fails to recognize that simple iterations (like the desired pattern) often only require the main loop counter and the input variable (N). Introducing unnecessary variables (`a`, `b`, `c`) that either hold static values (like 1) or redundant information (like N) indicates a rigid, formula-based approach to problem-solving rather than a functional, control-flow based approach.",

          "conceptual_gap": "The conceptual gap is slight because the code works, but the student uses `a` (currently 1) as the lower bound for the main loop, writing `for (int i = a; ...)` instead of `for (int i = 1; ...)`. While functionally equivalent because `a` is 1, this reliance on an intermediary, non-essential variable demonstrates a lack of confidence in directly using constants or the input variable `N` as boundaries/initializers.",
