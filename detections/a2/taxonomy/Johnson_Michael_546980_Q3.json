When execution enters the 'else' block following A-grade checks, Java implicitly guarantees the grade is less than 90. Therefore, the upper bound checks (e.g., `&& grade <= 89`) are redundant, demonstrating a limited understanding of how cascading conditional branches logically partition the input space.",
