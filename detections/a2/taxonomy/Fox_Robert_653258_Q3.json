The student does not trust that the variable will simply retain its initialized value if execution falls through all other conditional paths, nor do they fully utilize the exhaustive nature of the final `else` block in an `if-else if` chain.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, a variable retains its initialized value if no subsequent assignment is executed. Because `letterGrade` is initialized to 'F' (Line 23) and the preceding `if-else if` blocks cover all criteria from 60 to 100, the execution path that leads to the final `else` block MUST correspond to grades less than 60. The nested explicit check `if (safe_grade < 60)` and the subsequent assignment `letterGrade = 'F'` are entirely redundant, demonstrating a flawed model of control flow completeness.",
