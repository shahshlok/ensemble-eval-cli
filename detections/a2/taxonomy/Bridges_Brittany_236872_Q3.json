          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that each range check within an `if-else if` block must be explicitly bounded (both lower and upper) to prevent overlap, treating each `else if` as if it were a standalone `if` statement. They do not rely on the sequential, mutually exclusive nature of the flow control to implicitly handle the upper bound limits.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The Java `if...else if` control structure guarantees mutual exclusion. Once the flow reaches an `else if (grade >= 80)`, it is already computationally guaranteed that `grade` is < 90 (because the previous `if (grade >= 90)` failed). Therefore, the explicit upper bounds (`&& grade <= 89`, `&& grade <= 79`, etc.) are redundant and demonstrate a failure to utilize the inherent logic of sequential conditional structures.",
