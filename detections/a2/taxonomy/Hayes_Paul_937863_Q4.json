          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, a for-loop\u2019s control variable is updated in a very specific, mechanical way: initialization happens once, then on each iteration the condition is checked, the body executes, and finally the update expression runs. The outer loop\u2019s counter (currentRowNumber) is what determines which row we are on, and it should be changed only by the for-loop\u2019s own update clause, not manually inside the inner loop. By incrementing currentRowNumber inside the inner loop, the student is changing the loop-control variable in an unintended way. Because both currentStarCount and currentRowNumber increase together, the inner loop condition (currentStarCount <= currentRowNumber) never becomes false, leading to an effectively infinite loop rather than a neatly growing triangle. The student\u2019s mental model does not match the actual execution model where each loop variable has a clear, separate role and changing one inside the other\u2019s body directly affects the control flow.",

This linkage prevents the inner loop from terminating naturally, leading to a near-infinite loop situation where the program continues printing stars indefinitely (until resource exhaustion or manual stop) and simultaneously accelerates the outer loop counter far past its intended limit, causing the outer loop to terminate immediately after the first row attempt.",
