          "conceptual_gap": "While the code is syntactically correct and functionally works, it demonstrates a misconception about code clarity and efficiency. The student has created variables a=1, b=N, and c=b-a+1, then uses c as the loop limit. However, since a is always 1 and b is always N, the expression simplifies to just N. The student appears to believe that creating these intermediate steps makes the code clearer or more necessary, when in fact the loop could simply be 'for (int row = 1; row <= N; row++)'. This suggests a misunderstanding of when variable abstraction is actually needed versus when it adds unnecessary complexity.",

          "conceptual_gap": "The student introduces unnecessary intermediate variables (`a`, `b`, `c`) and a formula (`c = b - a + 1;`) to determine the loop boundary, when the variable `N` (the input height) itself is the correct, direct loop boundary. This demonstrates a failure to recognize the direct application of the input when defining iteration counts, perhaps due to over-generalization from array size problems or an attempt to use a formulaic approach for loop termination conditions.",
