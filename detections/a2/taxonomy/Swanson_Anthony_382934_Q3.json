Because of the sequential nature, once a condition is met (like `grade >= 90`), the subsequent checks are skipped. If the first condition fails, we already know `grade < 90`. Therefore, in the second `else if` block, checking `grade < a` (or `grade < 90`) is logically redundant and unnecessary for program correctness.
