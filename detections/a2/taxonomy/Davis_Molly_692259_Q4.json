The loop will continue as long as the condition is true, and it is the programmer's responsibility to ensure that the variables in the condition change in a way that will eventually make the condition false. By initializing `b` and using `b<=a` as the condition but then updating `a` instead of `b`, the student shows a gap in understanding how the loop's control variables interact over time and how termination is actually achieved in the notional machine.",

As a result, the inner loop never makes progress toward ending and also corrupts the outer loop\u2019s control variable a.
