This suggests a misunderstanding, or avoidance, of the direct self-assignment form (e.g., `count = count + 1` or `count++`).",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java and most imperative languages, the assignment operator (`=`) evaluates the entire expression on the right-hand side using the current values of variables before storing the final result in the variable on the left. The student's method of using intermediates (`newSum`, `newCount`) is unnecessary, as the calculation and assignment can be achieved directly and more idiomatically (e.g., `sum += value;` or `count++;`). The conceptual gap is treating assignment as a two-step ritual (calculate new state, then apply new state) instead of a single atomic instruction.",
