          "conceptual_gap": "The student has not internalized how `nextInt(n)` works: it generates a number from 0 to n-1 (exclusive of n). When `rand.nextInt(100)` is called, it produces 0-99. Adding 1 gives 1-100, which is correct. However, the student's approach of assigning values to `a` and `b` as 100 and 1, then using them in the formula, suggests they may be thinking of these as direct range boundaries rather than understanding the actual mechanics. The bigger issue is that this works correctly by accident\u2014the student has arrived at the right answer through what appears to be a misalignment of understanding. The critical gap: `nextInt(100)` does NOT generate 1-100; it generates 0-99.",
          "error_manifestation": "No runtime error or wrong output in this specific case (the code happens to work), but the student's mental model of how `nextInt()` operates is flawed, which could lead to bugs in similar scenarios with different parameters.",

          "conceptual_gap": "The student unnecessarily initializes the 'guess' variable to 0 (line 13). Since the first successful guess terminates the loop and the guess count starts at 0, this initial 'guess' value is irrelevant and simply exists to make the expression `guess != answer` valid before the first iteration. A more efficient structure (like a do-while loop or initializing `guess` inside the loop with a priming read) would avoid this artificial initialization.",
