          "conceptual_gap": "In lines 53-56, the `continue` statement is strictly unnecessary. Because the range check is enclosed in an `if` block, if the condition is met, the code naturally skips the remaining `else if` logic anyway (which only executes if the guess matches or doesn't match the secret). The use of `else` structures or `return` from a method is often what is needed, and here, the `if/else` is logically sufficient without `continue`.",
