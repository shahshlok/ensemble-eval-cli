          "conceptual_gap": "While the student's mathematical shortcut works for this specific grading scheme, relying on integer division (`a = n/10`) coupled with equality checks (`a == 8`) is a fragile method for boundary checking. The standard programming model requires explicit relational checks on the original variable (n) to ensure robustness against non-multiples of ten, non-integer inputs, or inputs outside the expected defined range (0-100). The student's model avoids the core conceptual task of defining ranges using relational operators.",

When grade is 80-89, dividing by 10 gives 8 (correct for B). However, this approach loses the ones digit entirely\u2014it treats 80-89 as equivalent to 80-89, which happens to work.

Although grades 10-59 calculate `a` as 1-5 and correctly fall into the final `else` ('F'), grades 0-9 calculate `a` as 0, which also falls into the final `else`, making the logic technically correct for the 'F' category, but conceptually flawed because the student only explicitly checked for tens digits 6, 7, 8, and 9.",
