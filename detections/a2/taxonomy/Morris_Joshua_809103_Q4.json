They seem to think currentRowNumber should change with each star printed in the row, and that the for-loop header will still handle the overall looping correctly regardless of this manual modification.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, a for-loop\u2019s control variable is just an ordinary variable: changing it inside the loop body immediately affects both the inner and outer loop conditions that depend on it. In nested loops for pattern printing, the outer loop counter should represent the current row and stay fixed during the inner loop, while the inner loop counter represents how many characters are printed in that row. By incrementing currentRowNumber inside the inner loop, the student breaks this separation of roles, causing the inner loop\u2019s termination condition (currentStarCount <= currentRowNumber) to keep being extended and preventing the inner loop from ever finishing. Their mental model misses that the inner loop condition is reevaluated each iteration using the updated value of currentRowNumber, and that the outer loop\u2019s increment will also run after the inner loop completes, so manual adjustment is neither needed nor safe.",
