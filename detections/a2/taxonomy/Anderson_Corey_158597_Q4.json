          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, a `for` loop with `for (int i = start; i < limit; i++)` executes the body for values `start, start+1, ..., limit-1`.

To run the body N times starting from 1, the correct condition is `i <= N`, or alternatively to start from 0 and use `i < N`. The student's model does not account for this exclusivity of the upper bound, leading them to systematically undercount iterations (producing one fewer row and one fewer star per row than intended).",
