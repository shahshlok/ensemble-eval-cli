          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, == compares object references (memory addresses), not the string content itself. For string comparison, the .equals() method should be used. The expression `badInput != null` will always be true if badInput is assigned (which it always is when scanner.next() succeeds), so this check doesn't validate whether the input is non-empty or meaningful.",
