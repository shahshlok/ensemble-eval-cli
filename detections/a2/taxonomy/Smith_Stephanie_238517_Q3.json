When you write several ifs in a row, the program checks every condition in order, and all whose conditions are true will execute. Mutual exclusivity only happens when conditions are explicitly connected with else / else if, or when the conditions themselves are written to be non-overlapping. Here, because the conditions are overlapping ranges (>=90, >=80, >=70, >=60), a grade like 95 or 85 satisfies multiple conditions, so multiple print statements run.
