The student feels they must create a new, local, explicitly typed variable (`numberToAddToSum`) right before use to ensure the integrity of the value being added.",
          "conceptual_gap": "Java variables maintain their declared type and assigned value until they are explicitly reassigned. Once `currentUserInputValue` is read as an `int`, its type and value are stable within the scope. Creating a copy (`numberToAddToSum`) is entirely redundant and suggests an anxiety about the computer's state management or type system, possibly relating to a 'Fluid Type' or 'Reactive State' machine belief where state is ephemeral or volatile.",
