          "conceptual_gap": "The loop body contains the input prompt, the input reading (`guess = scanner.nextInt()`), and the guess count increment, followed by the conditional printing of 'Too high!' or 'Too low!'. When the user enters the correct answer, the loop condition (L11: `while (guess != answer)`) is true, so the body executes. The input is read (L14), `guessCount` is incremented (L15). On the very first correct guess, the `if/else if` block (L17-L21) is completely skipped because neither `guess < answer` (False) nor `guess > answer` (False) are true. The loop then checks the condition L11 again with the new `guess`, finds it to be false, and terminates, proceeding to print the success message. The logic is functionally correct in Java, even though the placement of the check is slightly unusual (checking the condition *before* the first guess is read, and *after* all subsequent guesses).",
