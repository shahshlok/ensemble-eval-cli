          "conceptual_gap": "The student doesn't fully grasp that the if-else-if chain creates mutually exclusive conditions. Once a grade fails the first condition (grade >= 90), it will never be \u2265 100 anyway. The upper bound check (grade <= 100) is redundant because any grade \u2265 90 that reaches this line must be in the valid range. The subsequent else-if statements naturally handle the remaining ranges without needing explicit upper bounds.",
          "error_manifestation": "The code actually works correctly for valid inputs (0-100), so this is a logic clarity issue rather than a runtime error. However, it demonstrates flawed reasoning about how conditional chains work and could lead to bugs if the logic were modified (e.g., if someone tried to apply the same pattern to the B range and added 'grade <= 89', thinking it's necessary).",
