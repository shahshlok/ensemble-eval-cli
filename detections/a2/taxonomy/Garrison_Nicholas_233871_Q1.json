          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, each execution of the loop body runs sequentially and independently: a variable declared inside the loop body is created anew and initialized every iteration, and it does not remember values from previous iterations.

To accumulate across iterations, the same variable (e.g., `sumOfEvenNumbers`) must be updated without being reset, typically using `sumOfEvenNumbers = sumOfEvenNumbers + userInputValue;` or `+=`. The student's mental model treats the redeclared local sum as if it magically included prior numbers, which conflicts with how variable scope and lifetime work in Java.",
