To iterate exactly `n` times using a 1-indexed counter, the termination condition must be `i <= n` (or, if iterating on `i` from 1 to `n-1`, the structure is complex and unnecessary). In this case, since the program is supposed to print `N` rows, the loop only executes for rows 1 through `N-1`, skipping the final, full row.
