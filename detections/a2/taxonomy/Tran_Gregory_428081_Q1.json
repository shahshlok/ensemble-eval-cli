Each time through the loop, `currentEvenNumberSum` is re-declared and reset to 0, then set to `0 + userInputValue`, meaning it only ever holds the current even number. The statement `sumOfEvenNumbers = currentEvenNumberSum;` therefore overwrites any previous total with just the current even value. To accumulate a running total, the code must explicitly add to `sumOfEvenNumbers` (e.g., `sumOfEvenNumbers += userInputValue;`) rather than repeatedly assigning it to a fresh temporary. The gap is between viewing `=` as a declarative, always-true equation and understanding it as a procedural, moment-in-time update that can overwrite prior state.",
