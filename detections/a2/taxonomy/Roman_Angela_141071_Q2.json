To receive a new value from the user, the input method (keyboardScanner.nextInt()) must be explicitly invoked EACH iteration of the loop.

This causes either an infinite loop (if first guess is wrong) or immediate exit (if first guess is correct), rather than the intended repeated prompting behavior.",
