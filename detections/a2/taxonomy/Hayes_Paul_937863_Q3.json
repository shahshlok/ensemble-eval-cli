          "conceptual_gap": "The student does not fully grasp that once a condition fails in an if-else chain, the subsequent conditions are only evaluated if the previous ones were false. This means checking `userInputGrade <= 89` in the B case is redundant\u2014we already know the grade is less than 90 (since the A condition failed). The upper bound checks (e.g., `<= 89`, `<= 79`, `<= 69`) are logically unnecessary and represent defensive coding that suggests the student views each condition as independent rather than as part of a decision tree.",
