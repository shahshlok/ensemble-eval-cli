To include `n` as a value of `a`, the correct condition is `a <= n`. The student's code therefore executes the outer loop `n-1` times instead of `n` times, producing one fewer row than intended. Their correct use of `<=` in the inner loop suggests they may not fully connect the loop condition to the exact set of values taken by the loop variable, or they may inconsistently apply inclusive vs. exclusive bounds.",
