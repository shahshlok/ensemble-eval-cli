          "conceptual_gap": "A 'for' loop's initialization clause (`currentRowNumber = 1`) and continuation condition (`currentRowNumber <= userInputHeight`) strictly define the guaranteed range of the loop variable within its execution block. The `if (currentRowNumber > 0)` check is entirely redundant because it is logically impossible for `currentRowNumber` to be 0 or negative immediately after the loop condition check passes (since it starts at 1). This shows the student does not fully internalize the state guarantees provided by the loop control structure.",
