          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, the `while` loop condition (`currentUserGuessNumber != secretAnswerNumber`) is checked *before* each iteration. When the guess is correct (L38), the 'Correct!' message is printed, but the loop continues to the end of the block (L41). On the next iteration (L20), the condition is checked again, finds `currentUserGuessNumber == secretAnswerNumber` (zero difference), and the loop terminates. The core problem is that the student prints the success message and game summary *inside* the loop structure designed only for feedback and input repetition, meaning the success message and guess count are triggered *before* the loop is allowed to terminate cleanly.",
          "error_manifestation": "Logical flaw in program structure, resulting in correct functionality but inefficient loop usage, as the success output occurs inside the iteration that should be the last, often leading to unexpected behavior if subsequent code existed after the loop but was meant to run only on success.",
