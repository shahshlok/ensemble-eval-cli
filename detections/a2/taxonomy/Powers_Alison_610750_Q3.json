          "conceptual_gap": "In Java's sequential execution model, the `else if` structure creates mutually exclusive blocks. When execution reaches an `else if`, the previous conditions (which define the higher boundaries) are guaranteed to be false. Therefore, explicitly checking the upper bound (e.g., `&& numericGradeValue <= 89`) is logically redundant and signals a misunderstanding of how the control flow narrows the input space.",

          "conceptual_gap": "The student doesn't fully recognize that in an if-else chain, once a condition fails, all previous conditions are guaranteed to be false. For example, after checking `numericGradeValue >= 90` fails (moving to the next else-if), there's no need to check `<= 100` again in the B condition\u2014we already know the grade is less than 90. Similarly, after the B condition fails, we know the grade is less than 80, making the `<= 79` check in the C condition redundant.
