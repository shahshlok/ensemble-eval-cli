If the correct guess is made, the program prints the 'Correct!' message and increments the guess counter, but then immediately prints 'Too high!' or 'Too low!' based on the comparison done *after* the correct answer is found. The correct answer being equal to itself makes the `else` block (Step 13) execute, but the student has incorrectly placed the comparison logic outside the loop body which causes the redundant output.",
