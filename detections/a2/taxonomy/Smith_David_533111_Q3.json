          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that every condition in an 'if-else if' chain must explicitly test both the lower and the upper bound of the acceptable range for a grade boundary. They treat each check as a fully self-contained Boolean expression, ignoring the implicit constraints inherited from the preceding failed conditions.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The actual Java execution model ensures that when an 'else if' block is reached, all prior conditions are false. For example, when checking for a 'B' grade (line 14), the fact that execution is in the 'else' branch guarantees `grade < 90`. Therefore, the check `grade <= 89` is logically redundant. This flawed mental model fails to fully grasp how state (the range of possible values for 'grade') is narrowed sequentially by the flow control structure.",
