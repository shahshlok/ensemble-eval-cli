          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that an input value, once read and assigned to `value`, should be immediately copied into a separate variable (`temp`) before being utilized in logical checks or arithmetic operations. This suggests a belief that intermediate processing steps require dedicated, distinct variable storage, perhaps treating `value` primarily as an 'input receptacle' rather than a stable general-purpose integer variable.",
          "conceptual_gap": "For primitive types like `int`, assignment creates a stable, usable copy of the value. There is no operational difference between using `value` and using `temp` in this context. The creation of `temp` is redundant, leading to inefficient and verbose code, though it does not cause a functional execution error.",
