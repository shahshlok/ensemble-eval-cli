          "conceptual_gap": "The student does not fully use the cascaded nature of the 'if/else if' control structure. In Java, when an 'else if (C2)' is reached, it is guaranteed that the previous condition 'if (C1)' was false. Therefore, using redundant constraints (like 'grade <= 89' after failing the 'grade >= 90' check) reveals an inefficient and misunderstanding of how sequential branching restricts subsequent execution paths.",
