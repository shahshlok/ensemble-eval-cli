For example, they feel they must explicitly define 'a' as the number, 'b' as the divisor, and 'c' as the remainder, rather than evaluating the expression directly.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student fails to utilize Java's capability for efficient expression evaluation. The three intermediate variables (`a`, `b`, `c`) and multiple assignments are completely unnecessary as the logic `if (userInputValue % 2 == 0)` achieves the same result instantaneously without redundant variable declarations, assignment overhead, and memory allocation within every iteration of the loop.",

This indicates a lack of understanding that intermediate variable assignments are often syntactic sugar for a more complex expression, and are not strictly required for simple arithmetic operations like modulus.
