They may not fully realize that the increment expression is just arbitrary code that must explicitly update the same variable used in the loop condition.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, a for-loop is purely syntactic sugar for a specific control-flow pattern: initialize; then repeatedly test the condition; execute the body; execute the increment expression. The increment expression does not \"know\" which variable is the loop counter\u2014it only does exactly what is written. Here, the inner loop is declared with j as its counter and uses j in the condition, but the increment expression updates i instead. As a result, j never changes, the condition j <= i remains true indefinitely while i keeps increasing, and the inner loop never terminates. The student's mental model seems to separate the idea of a loop counter from the explicit variable being incremented, instead of understanding that the same variable must be used consistently in initialization, condition, and increment.",
