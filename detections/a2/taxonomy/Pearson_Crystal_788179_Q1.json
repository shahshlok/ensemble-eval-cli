          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that to sum only even numbers, they need to create a conditional multiplier (1 for even, 0 for odd) and multiply the number by this multiplier before adding it to the sum, rather than using a direct if statement to conditionally add values.",
          "conceptual_gap": "While the student's approach is mathematically correct and will produce the right answer, it demonstrates a misunderstanding of how to structure conditional logic in programming. The student hasn't grasped that `if(n % 2 == 0) y += n;` is the straightforward and idiomatic way to conditionally accumulate values. Instead, they're using an indirect method with intermediate variables (a, b, c) that obfuscates the intent. This suggests the student may not fully understand that conditionals can directly control which statements execute, and instead views the problem as requiring mathematical manipulation to 'encode' the condition.",
          "error_manifestation": "The code produces correct output, but the unnecessarily complex approach with extra variables (a, b, c) and multiplication-by-boolean-as-integer indicates a conceptual misunderstanding of conditional execution.",
