The Java execution machine guarantees that if it reaches an `else if` statement, all previous conditions were false.

          "conceptual_gap": "The student has created variables to hold threshold values but then uses hardcoded literal values in some comparisons while using variables in others. For example, the condition `grade >= a && grade <= 100` uses the variable `a` but the hardcoded literal `100`. More critically, the conditions `grade <= 89`, `grade <= 79`, and `grade <= 69` use literals instead of `b-1`, `c-1`, and `d-1` respectively. This shows the student doesn't fully understand that conditional logic requires consistent reference to boundary values, not a mix of variables and literals. The actual Java execution treats each literal as a distinct value, not as a reference to the stored variable.",

However, the code is fragile and inconsistent\u2014it mixes variable and literal comparisons, making it prone to logic errors. More fundamentally, using `grade <= 100` is redundant since valid grades are 0-100, and using `grade <= 89` instead of comparing against `b-1` shows incomplete understanding of the threshold boundaries.",
