          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, the loop condition `i < 5` is checked *before* each iteration, and the body only executes while the condition is true. Starting from `i = 1`, the loop runs for `i = 1, 2, 3, 4` and then stops when `i` becomes 5, because `5 < 5` is false. That means the loop runs exactly 4 times, not 5. To execute the body 5 times starting from 1, the correct condition would be `i <= 5`; or, more idiomatically, start from 0 and use `i < 5`.
