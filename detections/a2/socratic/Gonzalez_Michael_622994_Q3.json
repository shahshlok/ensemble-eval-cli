          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that when checking ranges using an `if-else if` chain, every condition must explicitly define both the lower bound and the upper bound (e.g., `grade >= 80 && grade <= 89`) to ensure the correct range is selected. They do not rely on the cascading nature of the `else if` structure to implicitly enforce the upper boundary based on the failure of previous, higher-grade checks.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java's `if-else if-else` structure, conditions are mutually exclusive and evaluated sequentially. Once an `else if` path is reached, all preceding conditions are known to be false. Therefore, for grading logic sorted descendingly (A, B, C, D), checking the upper limit in subsequent clauses is redundant. For example, if the program reaches the check for grade 'B', it is already guaranteed that `grade < 90`, so only `grade >= 80` is logically necessary.",
