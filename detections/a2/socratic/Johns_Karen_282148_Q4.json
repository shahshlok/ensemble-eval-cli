Further, the student declares an extraneous variable (`c`) that is never used, suggesting a general habit of premature declaration without clear purpose.",
          "conceptual_gap": "Java allows loop variables to be declared directly within the `for` loop header (e.g., `for (int a = 1; ...)`), which limits their scope to the loop block, improves code readability, and removes the need for premature or redundant initialization in the broader method scope. The current setup initializes `a` and `b` twice, demonstrating an inefficient use of variable initialization and limited understanding of variable scoping rules vs. the `for` loop initialization segment.",

The student may think that pre-declaring all variables somehow prepares the program or makes it run better.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, variables only need to be declared once and can be initialized where they're first used. Declaring `b` and `c` with initial values before their actual use is redundant and suggests the student doesn't fully understand variable scope and when declaration/initialization is necessary. The variable `c` in particular indicates the student may have copied this pattern without thinking about whether all declared variables serve a purpose.",
