They treat each condition as an isolated check that must fully specify the range, neglecting the inherent sequential exclusion provided by the `else if` structure.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In the Java execution model, the `else if` guarantee is that the current condition is checked only if all preceding conditions in the ladder were false. When checking grades in descending order (90s, then 80s, etc.), once the 'A' condition (`grade >= 90`) fails, the interpreter implicitly ensures that the grade is less than 90 for the subsequent 'B' check. Therefore, explicitly writing the upper bound (`&& grade <= 89`) is redundant and unnecessary for correctly defining the range.",
