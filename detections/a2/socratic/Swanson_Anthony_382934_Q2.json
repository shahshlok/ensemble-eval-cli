The issue is that `a = 100` and `b = 1`, so `nextInt(100) + 1` does work correctly, but the student's choice to use variables instead of the literal hint formula obscures the logic.

Since 0 is usually outside the valid guess range (1-100), initializing `userGuess` to 0 works, but it reveals a procedural caution (or perhaps an instruction reliance) about loop conditions rather than a deep understanding that any value outside of `[1, 100]` or even a value *inside* that range (if different from `answer`) would work.",
