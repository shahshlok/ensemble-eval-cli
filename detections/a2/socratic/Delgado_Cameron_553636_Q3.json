Furthermore, the student lacks confidence that their exhaustive conditional logic (L21-L39) will successfully assign a value to `letterGradeResult`, necessitating a redundant check before printing the output.",
          "conceptual_gap": "Java's 'if-else if' structure is deterministic and short-circuiting. Once the execution enters an 'else if' block (L25), it is guaranteed that all previous 'if' and 'else if' conditions failed, implicitly setting an upper bound for the current check (e.g., a grade must be < 90 if the L21 block failed). The explicit boundary checks and the final guarded print statement (L44) show that the student does not fully rely on the guarantee of deterministic flow control.",

When evaluating the second `else if` (>= 80), the program implicitly already knows the grade must be less than 90.
