          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that in a nested for loop, the increment statement can apply to either the inner or outer loop variable interchangeably, or they may have gotten confused about which variable controls the inner loop's iteration.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, the increment statement in a for loop's header must update the loop control variable that appears in the condition. The inner loop's increment (starCount++) controls how many times the inner loop repeats for each outer loop iteration. By writing 'row_number++' instead of 'starCount++', the student has accidentally modified the outer loop's counter, which breaks the inner loop's logic and causes incorrect output or an infinite loop.",
          "error_manifestation": "Wrong output - the inner loop will not print the correct number of asterisks per row. The outer loop's row_number will increment unexpectedly, causing the pattern to be malformed or the program to hang.",
