The fact that the grade already failed the 'A' and 'B' checks implies it must be less than 80.

For example, if grade_input is 95, it will match 'A' correctly, but the student may not understand that the upper bounds in subsequent conditions (89, 79, 69) are unnecessary because the if-else chain already filters those cases.",

The check `grade_input <= 89` is mathematically correct but procedurally redundant IF the student had structured the checks correctly descending from the highest grade (which they did, but they also introduced logical flaws in combining the lower bound and the explicit upper bound).
