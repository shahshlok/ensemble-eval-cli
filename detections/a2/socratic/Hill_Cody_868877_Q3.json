          "conceptual_gap": "The student does not fully utilize the sequential exclusion provided by the 'else if' construct. Since the checks are ordered from highest grade (>=90) down, reaching the subsequent 'else if' block inherently guarantees that the grade is below the previously checked threshold. For instance, reaching the check for 'B' (>=80) already guarantees the grade is less than 90, making the `&& grade <= 89` condition redundant for integer input.",
