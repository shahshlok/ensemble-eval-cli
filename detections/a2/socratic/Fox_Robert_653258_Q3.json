Therefore, the subsequent inner check `if (safe_grade < 60)` is completely redundant, demonstrating a failure to utilize the flow control structure efficiently.",

The clamping logic adds unnecessary complexity. The student's mental model treats input validation as mandatory rather than understanding that the subsequent conditional logic is sufficient.
