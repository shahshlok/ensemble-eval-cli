The outer loop's condition (a <= userInputHeight) and update (a++) are evaluated only at the boundaries of each outer loop iteration, not continuously during the inner loop. Changing 'a' inside the inner loop does affect the current value of 'a' used in the inner loop's condition (b <= a), but it does not change how the outer loop will perform its next update step; after the inner loop finishes, the outer loop still executes 'a++' and then re-checks the condition. As a result, resetting 'a' to 0 inside the inner loop does not \"redefine\" the planned sequence of outer iterations; instead, it leads to a situation where 'a' keeps being reset and then incremented back to 1, causing an infinite loop and not the desired triangle. The student is treating the loop variable as if changing it mid-iteration rewires the loop's future structure, rather than understanding that the for-loop's control flow is predetermined by its header and executed in a fixed order.",
