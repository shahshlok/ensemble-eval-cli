          "conceptual_gap": "The Java execution model for an 'if-else if' ladder ensures mutual exclusion. Because the conditions are checked in descending order (A then B then C...), if control reaches an 'else if' branch (e.g., the one for B), the VM guarantees that the previous conditions (e.g., A: >= 90) failed. Therefore, checking the upper bound (e.g., <= 89) is logically redundant. The student's code reveals a lack of trust in or understanding of this efficient, sequential, and mutually exclusive control flow structure.",

          "conceptual_gap": "The student does not fully utilize the short-circuiting nature and sequential evaluation of the `if-else if` ladder. In Java, if execution reaches an `else if (condition)`, it is guaranteed that all preceding `if` and `else if` conditions were false. For grading scales, this means that once the code reaches the check for B (80-89), it is implicitly known that the grade is less than 90, making the upper bound check redundant and potentially hiding a more fundamental misunderstanding of range exclusion in sequential processing.",
          "error_manifestation": "The code works correctly due to the redundant checks, but the unnecessary complexity suggests a lack of confidence in the flow control or a misunderstanding of how sequential conditional checks establish boundaries.",
