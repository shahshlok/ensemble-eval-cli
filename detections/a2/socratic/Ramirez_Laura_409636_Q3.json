          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that when using an `if-else if` cascade for range checks, they must explicitly define both the upper and lower bounds for every range (except perhaps the first one), or they overlook the implicit boundary setting provided by the preceding conditions.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, an `if-else if` structure executes the first true block and skips the rest. If a value falls into an `else if` block (e.g., `letterGrade = \"B\"`), it is guaranteed *not* to have satisfied the previous `if` conditions. Therefore, checking `grade >= b` (grade >= 80) in the second block is sufficient because the code path guarantees `grade < 90` (otherwise it would have been 'A'). The student's redundant checks or range definitions show a lack of confidence in leveraging the sequential, exclusive nature of the `if-else if` construct for defining ranges.",
          "error_manifestation": "Wrong output. The logic is technically correct and follows the requirements due to the structure, but the underlying mental model fails to recognize the inherent optimization and robustness that the cascade provides. Had the student tried to be explicit in all cases (e.g., `else if (grade >= 80 && grade <= 89)`), it would have been functionally identical but demonstrated a similar belief that the upper boundary needs defining, which the structure handles automatically.",
