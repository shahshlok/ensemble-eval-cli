          "conceptual_gap": "The student has correctly implemented the required logic (print 'Too high' or 'Too low' for wrong answers) but forgot to consider what happens when the guess matches the answer *within the conditional chain* (`if/else if`). Because the loop condition is `guess != answer`, the conditional chain only executes for wrong guesses, but if the guess *is* correct, the `if (guess < answer)` and `else if (guess > answer)` branches are skipped. The loop terminates naturally because the condition `while (guess != answer)` is false. Since the requirement specifically asks for behavior on *wrong* guesses and the student correctly implements the loop to only proceed while the guess is wrong, this is not a strict logical error based on the prompt's requirements, but rather a perfect execution of correct logic. The crucial point is that there is *no* discernible notional machine misconception in this specific code structure, as all observed behavior aligns perfectly with the standard Java execution model.",
