          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that in an `if-else if` structure used for discrete ranges, every condition must explicitly check both the lower bound and the upper bound of the current range, just as they are defined in the problem description (e.g., 80-89). This indicates a lack of full trust or understanding that the `else if` mechanism automatically guarantees the upper bound has already been excluded by previous, higher conditions.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The Java execution model guarantees that if an `else if` block is reached, all preceding `if` and `else if` conditions were false. For grading, this means when checking for a 'B' (>= 80), the program already knows the grade must be < 90 because the 'A' condition failed. Therefore, checking for an upper limit (e.g., `&& numeric_grade <= 89`) is redundant and inefficient. The student's mental model does not fully exploit the sequential, mutually exclusive nature of the `if-else if` control flow.",
