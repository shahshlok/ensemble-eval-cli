          "conceptual_gap": "In Java's `if-else if` structure, if a preceding condition is true, subsequent `else if` conditions are entirely skipped. Since the student checked the grades in descending order (90+, then 80+), by the time the program reaches `else if (grade_value >= 80)`, it is guaranteed that `grade_value` must be less than 90. Therefore, the explicit upper bound check (e.g., `&& grade_value <= 89`) is logically redundant and reveals a misunderstanding of conditional exclusivity.",

When an `else if` branch is reached, Java already knows that all preceding conditions failed. For grading, if `grade_value >= 90` failed, the next check only needs to be `grade_value >= 80`.
