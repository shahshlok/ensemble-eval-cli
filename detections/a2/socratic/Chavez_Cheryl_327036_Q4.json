If `row` starts at 1 and is incremented by 1 each iteration, the values taken are `1, 2, ..., N-1`, which is exactly `N-1` iterations. To get N rows (1 through N), the loop condition must allow `row` to reach N (e.g., `row <= N`). The gap is between an intuitive, informal sense of \"from 1 to N\" and the precise, half-open interval semantics that Java actually uses with `<` in loop conditions.",
