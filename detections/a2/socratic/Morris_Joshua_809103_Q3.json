          "conceptual_gap": "The Java `if-else if` flow control structure ensures mutual exclusivity. If a later `else if` condition is evaluated, it is implicitly guaranteed that all preceding conditions failed. Therefore, checking the upper boundary (e.g., `numericGradeValue <= 89`) when checking for the 'B' grade is redundant because the code is only reached if the grade failed the 'A' check (i.e., it is already known to be less than 90). The student's model does not fully leverage the cascading nature of the `else` keyword.",

          "conceptual_gap": "The student does not fully utilize the short-circuiting and sequential nature of the `if-else if` construct. Because execution only reaches an `else if` block if all preceding conditions were false, the upper bound is implicitly guaranteed by the failure of the previous tests. For example, if execution reaches `else if (numericGradeValue >= 80 && numericGradeValue <= 89)`, the compiler already knows `numericGradeValue` is less than 90 (due to the failure of the first `if` statement). The check `&& numericGradeValue <= 89` is mathematically harmless but conceptually redundant, indicating a lack of trust in or understanding of the control flow mechanism.",
