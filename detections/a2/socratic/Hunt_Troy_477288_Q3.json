Therefore, they only check the minimum threshold for subsequent grades (B, C, D).",
          "conceptual_gap": "Java's `if-else if` structure simply checks if the current condition is true if all previous conditions were false. If an input is high (e.g., 101), the first condition `(grade >= 90 && grade <= 100)` fails because the upper bound is violated. Execution then falls through to the next block, `else if (grade >= 80)`. Since 101 is greater than 80, the student's code incorrectly assigns 'B' to an input grade of 101 (or any grade > 100), revealing a failure to fully manage input boundaries within the sequential control flow structure.",

So when checking 'grade >= b' (line 17), we implicitly know 'grade < 90'.
