          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that in Java, every instance of input data must be stored in a unique, explicitly named variable (a, b, c, d, e), and that the logic applied to that data (checking for evenness and summation) must be individually coded for each variable. They do not perceive reading and processing multiple inputs as a repeatable action that can be abstracted into a loop.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The Java execution model supports iteration via looping structures (`for` or `while`). These structures allow the computer to execute the same processing logic multiple times on different sequential pieces of data, making code scalable, readable, and efficient. The student's model forces them to write five distinct instructions for what should be a single, generalized instruction executed five times.",
