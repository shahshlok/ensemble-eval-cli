          "conceptual_gap": "Java's loop execution is strictly conditional. Since the outer loop initializes 'i' to 1 (line 9) and the condition is 'i <= n' (line 10), the variable 'i' (and therefore 'y') is guaranteed to be 1 or greater inside the outer loop body. The explicit check 'if (y != 0)' on line 13 is functionally redundant and showcases a lack of full confidence in or understanding of loop invariants established by prior code.",

The student treats negative input as something to 'fix' rather than something to either reject or handle through re-prompting.

While robust code often includes validation, these specific checks indicate a lack of confidence in how variable initialization (L6), user input reading (L7), and loop control (L9, L10) interact, leading to unnecessary complexity in the core logic. In Java, simple initialization `int n;` followed immediately by `n = x.nextInt();` within an `if` block, or relying solely on the loop condition, would suffice if the student trusted the flow.",
