They think the loop checks the condition at the start of each iteration and stops when b==a, but they haven't accounted for what happens when the user enters the correct guess.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student's code is actually correct for this specific logic, but the mental model reveals a potential fragility: they may not fully understand that the condition `b!=a` is evaluated before each loop iteration. More importantly, if we examine the flow: when b equals a, the loop exits WITHOUT printing 'Too high!' or 'Too low!' The student appears to understand this correctly, but the lack of an explicit acknowledgment in the code structure suggests they may not have fully reasoned through the control flow.",
          "error_manifestation": "No immediate error - the code actually works correctly for the given problem. However, the tight coupling of logic suggests the student may not have mentally modeled what happens when the condition becomes false.",

          "conceptual_gap": "While the logic is sound, the student may not explicitly understand why they must read `b` inside the loop rather than before it. A common misconception would be to read `b` before the loop, in which case the loop would never terminate correctly. The fact that they read it inside suggests they have the right mental model, but this may be through trial-and-error rather than explicit understanding.",

          "conceptual_gap": "While Java technically allows single-letter variable names, best practices dictate using meaningful names.
