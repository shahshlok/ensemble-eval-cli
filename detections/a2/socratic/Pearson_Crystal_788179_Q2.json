However, the structure reveals a potential misconception: the student may not fully understand that the loop condition is evaluated BEFORE each iteration. When a==n becomes true, the loop exits naturally. The student's code is actually correct here, suggesting they DO understand loop termination, but the logical flow (checking conditions inside vs. relying on loop condition) shows they may be thinking of the loop as 'keep asking until correct' rather than 'keep looping while not correct'.",
