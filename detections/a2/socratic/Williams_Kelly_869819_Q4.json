          "conceptual_gap": "While variable abstraction can be useful for readability and maintainability, in this case the student has introduced variables (a=1, b=N, c=b-a+1) that add computational steps without providing meaningful abstraction. The student appears not to recognize that c always equals N regardless of the values of a and b, suggesting they may not fully understand arithmetic simplification or may be over-engineering a simple loop range.",

Since 'b' is just 'N' and 'a' is 1, the explicit calculation is unneeded.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student performs a calculation (`c = b - a + 1;`) to determine the total number of iterations needed for the outer loop (which equals N), instead of simply using the input variable N directly as the loop bound. While mathematically correct in this specific context (where a=1), it demonstrates a lack of direct mapping between the problem requirement (N rows) and the loop control structure, suggesting they might be overcomplicating simple loop ranges.",
