They feel it is safer and necessary (as commented on line 22) to wrap the loop body or internal code blocks with explicit `if` statements to check conditions that are already guaranteed to be met by the surrounding loop's initialization or constraints.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, the initialization and conditional boundary of a `for` loop (e.g., `currentRowNumber = 1; currentRowNumber <= userInputHeight`) inherently guarantees the state of the loop control variable within the loop body. The check `if (userInputHeight > 0)` on line 23 is unnecessary because the `for` loop condition handles `userInputHeight <= 0`. Similarly, the check `if (currentRowNumber > 0)` on line 31 is redundant because `currentRowNumber` is initialized to 1 in the outer loop and only increases.",

While defensive checks can be good practice in some contexts, they misunderstand that a check inside a `for (currentRowNumber = 1; ...; ...)` loop is redundant\u2014`currentRowNumber` will always be >= 1 inside that loop body. The outer `if (userInputHeight > 0)` guard is reasonable, but the inner `if (currentRowNumber > 0)` reveals a belief that explicit checks prevent logical errors, when in reality the loop invariant already guarantees the condition.",
