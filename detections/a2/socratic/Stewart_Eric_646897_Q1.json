The prompt implicitly assumes valid input matching the sample run format ('Enter 5 integers: 3 8 2 7 4'). In standard introductory programming contexts, failure to read exactly 5 integers even if invalid input is present often indicates the student is overcomplicating the loop structure, or misinterpreting standard input stream termination/handling.
