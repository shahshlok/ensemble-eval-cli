Therefore, `limit` (L19) is guaranteed to be positive within the context of the outer `while` loop. The explicit check `if (limit >= 0)` is unnecessary because the program flow already guarantees this condition, suggesting a conceptual inability to rely on established programmatic invariants.",

By the time the code reaches the `if (limit >= 0)` check, limit is guaranteed to be at least 1. The check is redundant. The student may believe that variables can spontaneously become negative or that explicit bounds checking is always required, not recognizing that the control flow already guarantees the condition.",
