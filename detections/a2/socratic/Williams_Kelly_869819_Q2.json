          "conceptual_gap": "The student has misunderstood how `nextInt()` works. `nextInt(100)` returns values from 0 to 99, not 1 to 100. Adding 1 gives 1 to 100, which is correct. However, the student's approach of assigning `a = 100` and `b = 1` then computing `rand.nextInt(a) + b` is semantically correct but suggests they may not fully understand why this works. More critically, the problem hint explicitly shows `rand.nextInt(100) + 1`, but the student has generalized this into intermediate variables, which while not wrong, indicates possible confusion about the relationship between the parameters and the actual range. The code actually works correctly despite this potential misconception.",
          "error_manifestation": "No runtime error; the code actually produces the correct range (1-100). However, the indirection through variables `a` and `c` suggests the student may not have a clear mental model of why this specific formula produces the desired range.",

The extra variables (`a`, `b`, `c`) add complexity without purpose. This could indicate the student is uncertain about operator precedence or is overthinking the problem, possibly believing intermediate steps are required.",
