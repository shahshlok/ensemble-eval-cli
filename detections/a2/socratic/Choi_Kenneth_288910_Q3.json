As a result:\n- For `x` between 60 and 64, the outer `else if (x >= 60)` is true, the inner `if (x >= 65)` is false, so the **inner** `else` runs and prints `F` (even though the spec says D for 60\u201369).\n- For `x` below 60, none of the `if`/`else if` conditions are true, so **no branch executes at all**, and nothing is printed. There is no catch\u2011all `else` for the full chain.\nThe gap is that the student is thinking in terms of a human\u2011readable outline where the visible `else` at the end \u201ccovers everything else,\u201d instead of understanding Java\u2019s precise pairing of each `else` with the nearest `if` and the need for braces to express intended block structure.",
