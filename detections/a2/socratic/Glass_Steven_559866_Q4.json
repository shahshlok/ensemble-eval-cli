          "conceptual_gap": "The student's code: `int starsToPrint = row;` and the outer loop condition `while (row <= height)` where `row` starts at 1, guarantees that `starsToPrint` will always be greater than or equal to 1 inside the loop. The `if (starsToPrint > 0)` check is redundant and suggests a misunderstanding of what values `starsToPrint` can hold under the current control flow.",

          "conceptual_gap": "While checking for `height > 0` is good practice for robustness, in this specific `while` loop implementation, the inner structure already handles `height <= 0` gracefully. If `height` is 0 or negative, the condition `while (row <= height)` (where `row` starts at 1) will immediately be false, and the loop body will be skipped. The explicit `if` check is structurally redundant for *correctness* but indicates a fear of loop entry with invalid boundary conditions.",
