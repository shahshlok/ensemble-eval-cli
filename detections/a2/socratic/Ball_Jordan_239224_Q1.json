In Java, the expression on the right-hand side is fully evaluated first, and then the single resulting value is stored in the variable on the left-hand side. Using a temporary variable (like `newSum` or `newCount`) is redundant. Standard practice (and more efficient conceptual understanding) uses either direct assignment (`sumOfEvens = sumOfEvens + currentValue;`) or compound assignment (`sumOfEvens += currentValue;`).",
