They seem to treat variable definition as a placeholder or mandatory algebraic setup rather than strictly as a store for required operational data.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java (and most imperative languages), declaring and initializing a variable only impacts the machine state if that variable is subsequently read and used to alter program behavior. Variables `b` and `c` are initialized (and involve calculation) but are never referenced again, constituting dead code. The computational model does not require algebraic redundancy; it only executes instructions that contribute to the final state or output.",

          "conceptual_gap": "While technically the code works, initializing `a = 1` and then using `int i = a` in the for loop is unnecessarily indirect.
