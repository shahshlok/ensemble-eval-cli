For the inner loop, the condition is `j <= i`, so the loop\u2019s progress toward termination must involve changing `j` (or changing `i` in a way that makes `j <= i` eventually false). In the student\u2019s code, `j` never changes, while `i` is increased inside the inner loop. Because `j` stays at 1 and `i` keeps getting larger, the condition `j <= i` never becomes false, so the inner loop never terminates.

The inner loop condition `while (j <= i)` will only move toward termination if j changes in a way that eventually makes the condition false. Incrementing i inside the inner loop actually moves the boundary farther away, keeping `j <= i` true and causing the loop to never end. Similarly, incrementing i both inside the inner loop and again after it means i no longer cleanly represents 'current row'; its value becomes hard to reason about and breaks the intended structure.
