          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that in an `if-else if` chain, each subsequent `else if` statement must explicitly define both the lower and upper bounds of the grade range using the logical AND operator (`&&`). They appear to treat each condition as having to entirely define a closed interval, failing to utilize the benefit of the `else if` structure, which guarantees preceding conditions (and their corresponding upper bounds) have already been deemed false.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The `else if` structure in Java automatically ensures mutual exclusion. When the program reaches an `else if` block (e.g., checking for B: Grade >= 80), it is guaranteed that the previous `if` conditions (e.g., Grade >= 90) were false. If the checks are ordered descendingly, the explicit constraint on the upper end of the range (e.g., `&& numericGradeValue <= 89`) is redundant. The student's mental model does not fully incorporate the flow control mechanism that narrows the remaining possibility space.",
          "error_manifestation": "No functional error, but the code is unnecessarily verbose and expresses a lack of trust in the cascading nature of `if-else if` logic.",
