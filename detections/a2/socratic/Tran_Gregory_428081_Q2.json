This preference for abstracting simple literals suggests discomfort with using numbers directly in expressions.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, using short-hand operators (`++` or `+= 1`) or numeric literals (`1`) is efficient and idiomatic for incrementing counters. Defining a new integer variable (`incrementGuessValue`) inside a frequently executed loop to hold the value of `1` is inefficient. It requires the system to initialize, assign, and possibly reallocate this temporary variable on every iteration, demonstrating a lack of awareness regarding code performance and memory cost associated with variable definition versus literal usage.",

In Java, `int secretAnswerNumber = randomBaseValue + 1;` is perfectly clear and idiomatic.
