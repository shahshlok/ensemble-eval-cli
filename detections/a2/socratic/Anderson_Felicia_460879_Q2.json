          "conceptual_gap": "The student has misunderstood how `nextInt()` works. `nextInt(100)` generates a number from 0 to 99 (not 1 to 100). Adding 1 gives a range of 1 to 100, which is correct by coincidence of the values chosen. However, the student's assignment of `a = 100` and `b = 1`, then using `rand.nextInt(a) + b`, suggests they think `nextInt()` takes the upper bound directly. The hint provided uses `rand.nextInt(100) + 1` correctly, but the student has abstracted it into variables without fully understanding the semantics. The correct understanding is that `nextInt(n)` returns 0 to n-1, so you need `nextInt(100) + 1` for 1-100 range.",
          "error_manifestation": "The code happens to work correctly by accident (produces numbers 1-100), but the student's mental model is flawed. If they changed `a` to a different value expecting proportional behavior, the bug would manifest. For instance, if they thought they could get 1-50 by setting `a = 50, b = 1`, they would get 1-50 (still works), but their reasoning is incorrect.",

          "conceptual_gap": "While not strictly a misconception that causes incorrect behavior, this reveals the student may think that breaking down a computation into multiple variable assignments adds clarity or is required. In Java, this is just verbose; the logic is correct but the student hasn't grasped that `int answer = rand.nextInt(100) + 1;` is clearer and more direct. This suggests the student might not fully understand variable scope and assignment semantics.",
          "error_manifestation": "No runtime error or wrong output, but indicates a misunderstanding of code efficiency and clarity. The student may also be uncertain about whether `rand.nextInt(a)` directly uses the variable or if it needs to be pre-computed.",
