          "conceptual_gap": "The student's mental model is actually correct here\u2014the while loop DOES exit when `g!=n` becomes false (i.e., when g equals n). However, the code structure suggests the student may not fully appreciate that the loop continues indefinitely until this exact condition is met. The student may not have explicitly considered what happens if they never enter the correct branch, or may not realize that the counter increments even on correct guesses before the loop evaluates the condition again.",
          "error_manifestation": "The code actually works correctly for the happy path. However, there's a subtle logical issue: the counter `c` is incremented BEFORE the comparison, so if a guess is correct, it still gets counted before the loop exits. This is actually the intended behavior based on the sample output, so this may not be a misconception.",

          "conceptual_gap": "While this approach works in practice, it reveals the student may not have fully considered defensive programming or what happens if the random number generated happens to be outside the expected range, or if there's an off-by-one error. More importantly, initializing `g` to 0 (which is outside the valid guess range) works here but is somewhat fragile. A more explicit approach would be to initialize `g` to a sentinel value and perhaps add a comment explaining the logic.",

However, this matches the expected output where a correct guess on the third try shows 'You took 3 guesses', so the student's mental model here is actually aligned with requirements.",
