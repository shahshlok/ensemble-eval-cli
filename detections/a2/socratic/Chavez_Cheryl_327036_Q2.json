          "conceptual_gap": "The student doesn't recognize that `userGuess` is initialized to 0, which is not equal to `answer` (a number between 1-100). While this doesn't cause a logical error in this specific case, it reveals a shallow understanding of loop initialization. The student should recognize that initializing to 0 is acceptable here only by coincidence\u2014it happens to satisfy the loop condition. A more robust initialization would be to `userGuess = -1` or some other sentinel value, or to use a do-while loop instead. This suggests the student hasn't thought deeply about why loop variables need initialization.",

          "conceptual_gap": "The student doesn't fully grasp that the `else` block (which prints the success message) will execute, but only on the final iteration before the loop exits. While functionally correct, this reveals the student may not fully understand control flow: they've used an `else` to handle equality within a loop that's already checking for inequality. A clearer pattern would be to break immediately or restructure the logic. The student seems to think of the if-else as the primary control mechanism rather than recognizing the while loop's role.",
