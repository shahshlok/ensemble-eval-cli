They are likely thinking: 'If it's 90 or more, it will print A and then not consider the B, C, or D checks; if it's 80 or more, it will print B and not consider the later ones,' so they don't feel the need to write explicit upper bounds like grade >= 80 && grade < 90.",

The computer does not infer that conditions are meant to be mutually exclusive just because they are written in sequence. As a result, for a grade of 95, all of the conditions grade >= 90, grade >= 80, grade >= 70, and grade >= 60 are true, so every corresponding println will execute, producing multiple letter grades.
