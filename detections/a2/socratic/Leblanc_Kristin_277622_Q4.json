They are not clearly distinguishing between a condition that is true for i < n (stopping before n) and one that allows i to actually reach n.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, the for-loop condition is checked before each iteration, and the body only runs when the condition is true. A condition of 'i < n' means the last value of i that executes the body is n-1, so the loop runs (n-1) times, not n times. To execute for i = 1, 2, ..., n, the condition must allow i to be equal to n (e.g., 'i <= n'). The student's inconsistent use of '<' in the outer loop and '<=' in the inner loop suggests they do not yet have a solid mental model of how loop bounds map to the actual set of values taken by the loop counter.",
