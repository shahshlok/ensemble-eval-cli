The loop will only terminate if the variable(s) used in the condition are actually changed in a way that makes the condition false. In the inner loop, the condition depends on j (j <= i), but the update expression changes i (i++). Since j never changes, the condition j <= i remains true forever once entered (j is 1 and i only increases), so the loop never terminates. The computer does not automatically associate the increment with the condition variable or understand the programmer\u2019s intent to \"move across the row\"; both the condition and the increment must be explicitly consistent (e.g., j++ when checking j <= i).",

The condition is checked each time, and the update expression is executed each time, but Java does not automatically connect these to a specific counter variable for the programmer. For a counting loop, the variable whose value appears in the condition (e.g., j <= i) must be updated in the third clause (e.g., j++). In the student's code, j is initialized and used in the condition, but never updated; instead, i is updated.
