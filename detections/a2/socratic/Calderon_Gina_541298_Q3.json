However, the nested condition `if (grade >= 65)` means grades 60-64 will print 'F', when they should print 'D'. The correct logic should be a simple `else if (grade >= 60)` without nesting, since all grades >= 60 and < 70 are D's. The student appears to think that grade 65 is a special threshold, when in fact the threshold for F is 60 (everything below 60). In an if-else chain, each condition implicitly inherits the negation of all previous conditions. By the time we reach `else if (grade >= 60)`, we already know grade < 70. Therefore, all grades in this branch are naturally in [60, 70). The student added redundant logic as if the upper bound (70) needed to be explicitly subdivided.",
