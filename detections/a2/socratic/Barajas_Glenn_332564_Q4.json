          "conceptual_gap": "The student doesn't fully understand that each for loop must have its own independent counter variable that is incremented in the increment clause. The increment statement must advance the loop's own counter (declared in the for statement), not a variable from an outer scope that happens to appear in the condition. In nested loops, each loop is responsible for controlling its own iteration by updating its own counter.",

When printing the first row, `currentStarCount` remains 1 (never incremented), `currentRowNumber` keeps incrementing, and the condition `1 <= currentRowNumber` is always true. The inner loop runs infinitely for every outer loop iteration.",
