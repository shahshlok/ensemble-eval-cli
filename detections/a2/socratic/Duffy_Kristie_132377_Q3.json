Explicitly writing '&& numeric_grade <= 89' is redundant in this control structure, suggesting the student does not trust or fully understand the exclusionary nature of the cascading conditionals.",

Therefore, explicitly checking the lower bound of a range (e.g., `numeric_grade <= 89`) is often redundant and indicative of not fully internalizing the sequential exclusion property of `else if` statements. For instance, after failing the 'A' condition (>= 90), the system already knows the grade must be < 90, making the check `numeric_grade <= 89` unnecessary.",
