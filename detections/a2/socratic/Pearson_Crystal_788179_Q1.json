          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that to use a number in a sum only when it meets a condition, they must convert the boolean result of the condition into a numeric multiplier (1 or 0) and then multiply the number by this multiplier to effectively 'include' or 'exclude' it from the sum.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student has not recognized that Java provides an `if` statement specifically designed for conditional execution. Instead of using `if (n % 2 == 0) { y += n; }`, they are using ternary operators and arithmetic multiplication to achieve the same effect. While their approach technically works, it reveals a mental model where they see conditionals as numeric operations rather than control flow statements. This suggests the student may not fully understand that `if` statements allow code to execute or skip entirely, not just modify values.",
          "error_manifestation": "The code produces correct output (14 for the sample input), so there is no runtime error or wrong answer. However, the unnecessarily complex approach suggests incomplete understanding of control flow structures.",

They think that decomposing the logic into multiple assignment statements with separate variables is the correct way to structure a program.",
          "conceptual_gap": "While multiple variables aren't inherently wrong, the pattern suggests the student may not fully understand that expressions can be nested and that intermediate results don't need explicit storage. The student appears to lack confidence in combining operations directly (e.g., using `if (n % 2 == 0)` directly in a condition rather than storing `n % 2` in variable `a` first). This indicates a mental model where each operation must be broken down and stored before it can be used again.",
