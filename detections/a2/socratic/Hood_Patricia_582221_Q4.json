          "conceptual_gap": "The Java execution model allows loop boundaries to be set directly using existing variables (like `N`). The introduction of `a=1`, `b=N`, and the subsequent calculation of `c = b - a + 1` to define a loop limit that is simply `N` is superfluous. This suggests a misunderstanding of direct variable reuse in loop boundaries, favoring a fixed, formulaic template.",
