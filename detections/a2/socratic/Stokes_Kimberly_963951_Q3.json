          "conceptual_gap": "When using an `if-else if` structure, the control flow inherently establishes boundaries. If the program reaches an `else if` block, all preceding conditions must have been false. For example, to check for a 'B', the student only needs to check `grade >= 80` because if the grade were 90 or above, the program would have executed the 'A' block and skipped the rest. Explicitly checking `grade <= 89` is redundant because the condition `grade < 90` is already guaranteed by the failure of the previous `if` statement.",

In Java, if `grade >= 90` is true and executed, all subsequent `else if` blocks are skipped. Therefore, when checking `else if (grade >= 80 ...)` it is already implicitly known that `grade < 90`. The explicit check `grade <= 89` or `grade <= 100` is unnecessary when moving down the scale.",
