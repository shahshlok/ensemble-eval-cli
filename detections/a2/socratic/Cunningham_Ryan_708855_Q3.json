          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that to guarantee a variable falls into a specific numeric interval (D, C, B, etc.) within an `if-else if` ladder, they must explicitly check both the lower bound and the upper bound using the `&&` operator in every conditional block (e.g., `grade >= 80 && grade <= 89`). They do not fully understand that the failure of the preceding conditional check already establishes the necessary upper limit for the current check.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java's `if-else if` control flow structure, the machine executes the conditions sequentially and exclusively. When the flow reaches an `else if` block, it is guaranteed that all previous conditions (e.g., A: `grade >= 90`) were false. Therefore, for a descending grade scale, the upper bound is implicitly defined by the structure itself. The explicit check for the upper limit (e.g., `grade <= 89` in the B block) is logically redundant because the flow only entered that block if the grade was already less than 90.",
