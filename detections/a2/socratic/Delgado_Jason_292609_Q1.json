This requires explicitly declaring five distinct variables, calling the input function five times, and writing the conditional summation logic five independent times. The student does not yet recognize the repetitive pattern or know how to generalize it using iterative control flow structures (loops) or scalable data structures (arrays).",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student's mental model views the execution as a hard-coded sequence of 10 distinct steps (5 inputs, 5 conditionals). The Java execution model provides `for` and `while` loops to allow a programmer to execute a block of code $N$ times dynamically without needing to write out $N$ repetitions of the code block. This allows for scalable and maintainable solutions, a concept the student has not yet incorporated into their programming workflow.",
