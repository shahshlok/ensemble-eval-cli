          "conceptual_gap": "The assignment `int numberOfStarsInRow = rowNumber;` is redundant. Since `rowNumber` is already an integer holding the correct value for the loop limit, the student is creating a new variable just to hold a copy of an existing variable in the immediate next line. This suggests a potential misunderstanding of variable scope, assignment efficiency, or an overly literal transfer of a mathematical statement into code structure, where they feel obligated to declare the relationship explicitly before use.",
