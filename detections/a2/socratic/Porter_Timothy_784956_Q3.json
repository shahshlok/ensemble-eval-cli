Furthermore, the entire inner `if (grade >= 65) ... else ...` block only executes when the outer condition `grade >= 60` is true. When `grade < 60`, the outer `else if (grade >= 60)` is skipped entirely, so the inner `if` and its `else` are never evaluated.

Second, and critically, because the entire F range (< 60) must be caught by an unconditional `else` at the highest level of the structure, the present code executes nothing when the grade is truly below 60, as the final conditional `else if (grade >= 60)` evaluates to false.
