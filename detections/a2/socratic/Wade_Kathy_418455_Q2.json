          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that the loop condition `while (userGuess != answer)` is sufficient to exit the loop only after a correct guess is processed, and implicitly, that the success message will only appear if the loop evaluates to false.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student has correctly implemented the core logic, which involves checking the guess *inside* the loop and providing feedback. However, their conditional statements (`if/else if`) inside the loop only cover the 'Too low!' and 'Too high!' cases, and they don't explicitly check for the 'Correct!' scenario using an `else` block or an explicit check for equality, because the structure of the `while` loop handles the correct guess exit implicitly. The student's code is strictly correct and fulfills the requirements, but a common beginner pattern is to explicitly check for equality inside the loop body, before it exits. Given the code's perfect functional correctness and adherence to the prompt, no significant logical flaw or notional misconception is evident regarding the control flow required for a guessing game.",
