          "conceptual_gap": "In Java's `if-else if` control flow, only one block can execute. Once the execution reaches an `else if` statement, the Java Virtual Machine guarantees that all preceding conditions were false. Since the grade checks are ordered from highest (A) to lowest (D), the upper boundary check (like `&& grade < a` or `&& grade < b`) is computationally redundant and unnecessary, as the failure of the preceding conditional already ensures that property.",
