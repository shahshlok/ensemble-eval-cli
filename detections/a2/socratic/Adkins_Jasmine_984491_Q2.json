          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, `Random.nextInt(n)` returns a value in the range [0, n-1], not [1, n]. So `rand.nextInt(100)` generates 0-99. Adding 1 gives 1-100, which is correct. However, the student's intermediate variable assignment suggests they may not fully understand this\u2014they assign 100 to variable `a`, then pass it to nextInt(). While this happens to work, it indicates the student might think the parameter directly represents the upper bound of the desired range rather than understanding the [0, n-1] semantics.",

You took X guesses.') inside the `else` block of the conditional statement is sufficient to achieve the desired output structure, regardless of where that block sits relative to the loop condition and the subsequent iterations.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student fails to recognize the crucial difference between outputting a result and terminating a loop. When the guess is correct (L24), the success message is printed, but the loop (`while (guess != answer)`) does not immediately terminate. It completes the current iteration, then checks the loop condition again (L16), finds `guess == answer` is false, and exits *before* the next guess prompt. Although the *program* functions correctly in terms of logic and output structure (because the loop exits immediately after the success message is printed, preventing repeated prompts), the student has structured the conditional logic (L21-L26) to manage comparison feedback *and* success output simultaneously, which is less robust than using a `break` or ensuring the final success output is handled outside the loop post-termination.",
          "error_manifestation": "No visible error in this implementation, but it reveals a fragile understanding of loop control and separation of concerns (`if/else if/else` logic vs. loop termination condition). The loop is technically redundant in the final iteration since the `else` block handles the success case and the loop condition immediately terminates thereafter.",
