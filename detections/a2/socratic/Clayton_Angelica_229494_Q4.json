The variable `i` is initialized to 1 and only increments. Therefore, within the context of the `while (i <= safeHeight)` loop, `i` (and consequently `starsToPrint`) is guaranteed to be 1 or greater. The check `if (starsToPrint < 0)` is logically unreachable, suggesting the student hasn't internalized how loop structure guarantees variable state.",

They think that even though `i` starts at 1 and only increments, it could somehow become negative, requiring a defensive check. Similarly, even though `starsToPrint` is assigned directly from `i` (which is always positive after the first guard), it could also become negative and needs its own guard.",

They add defensive checks (`if (starsToPrint < 0)`) that can never execute given the prior assignments and conditions. This suggests they view variables as having some inherent unpredictability rather than understanding that variable values are deterministic based on prior operations. In Java, once you assign `starsToPrint = i` where `i >= 1`, the value of `starsToPrint` is guaranteed to be >= 1; no defensive check is needed.",

          "conceptual_gap": "While creating a copy of a variable isn't incorrect per se, the pattern suggests the student doesn't fully understand that `safeHeight = height` creates an independent variable with a copy of the value. They seem to think that modifying or using `safeHeight` provides some additional safety that using `height` directly wouldn't provide. In reality, both would behave identically in this context. This reveals uncertainty about variable scope, independence, and the purpose of variables.",

While input validation (checking `height` on lines 10-12) is necessary, validating `starsToPrint` (which is assigned directly from the loop counter `i`, starting at 1) or validating `safeHeight` again if it were used later is based on a misunderstanding of variable scope and flow control.
