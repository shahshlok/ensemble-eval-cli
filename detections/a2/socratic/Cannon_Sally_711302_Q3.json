          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, integer division (/) truncates toward zero, discarding the remainder. When dividing a grade by 10, grades like 85 become 8, and grades like 89 also become 8. This works for the boundary cases (90-99 \u2192 9, 80-89 \u2192 8, etc.) but the student may not have explicitly reasoned through why this truncation is the correct approach, suggesting they didn't fully understand the mechanics of integer division.",
          "error_manifestation": "While the code produces correct output for the given sample (85 / 10 = 8, which correctly maps to 'B'), this approach is fragile. It works only because the grade boundaries happen to align with tens digits. The student may not realize this is coincidental rather than a robust solution.",

A more explicit approach (like `if (n >= 90)` directly) would show deeper understanding of the problem requirements.",

          "conceptual_gap": "While integer division is useful for classifying most grades (e.g., 80-89 maps to 8), it fails when the input grade is 100. If `n` is 100, then `n/10` results in 10. The student's first condition `(a >= 9)` correctly catches 9 and 10, thus handling the edge case of 100 by luck rather than intentional design for the maximum input. The conceptual gap is assuming that the typical logic handles all boundaries, particularly maximum specified inputs (like 100), without testing beyond standard inputs (like 90 or 99). This code is functionally correct for the problem boundaries (0-100), but the structure itself obscures the required boundary check for 100.",
