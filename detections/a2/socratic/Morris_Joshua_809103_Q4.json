By modifying currentRowNumber inside the inner loop, the student is unintentionally changing (1) the condition for the inner loop (currentStarCount <= currentRowNumber) and (2) the state that the outer loop relies on, which can lead to non-terminating behavior.

The `for` header already specifies how and when it is updated (`currentRowNumber++` at the end of each outer-loop iteration). If you additionally modify that same variable inside the loop body, you are changing the value that both the outer loop and any conditions using it rely on. In this code, the inner loop condition `currentStarCount <= currentRowNumber` is reevaluated after each increment of **both** `currentStarCount` and `currentRowNumber`, causing them to grow together and preventing the inner loop from ever terminating. The student\u2019s mental model treats `currentRowNumber` as a kind of separate, conceptual \"row counter\" that can be adjusted independently for correctness, rather than as the exact numeric value that determines whether loops continue or stop. They are also conflating responsibilities: the outer loop\u2019s counter should stay fixed during one row to represent that row, while the inner loop\u2019s counter controls how many stars to print in that row.",
