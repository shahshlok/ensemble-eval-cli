Since the initial guess is read *before* the counter starts incrementing or checking, if the first guess is correct, the loop never runs, and the counter remains at 0 (L12). The student attempts to count the attempts that happen *after* the initial guess, rather than counting the total guesses (including the first one). Because the loop is infinite if the guess is wrong (due to the Input Update Misplacement), the output calculation is secondary, but if it terminated correctly, the attempt count would be off by one (always counting comparisons made inside the loop, missing the initial guess if it was correct, or just counting subsequent guesses if comparison was successful).",
