          "conceptual_gap": "Java's `if-else if` structure ensures sequential exclusion. If execution reaches an `else if` block, it is guaranteed that the previous `if` condition was false. For example, reaching the B grade check (`grade >= 80`) inherently means the grade must be less than 90 (or less than 80 for the C grade check). Explicitly checking the upper bound (`&& grade <= 89`) is logically redundant since the control flow already restricts the input range from above. This indicates the student views the checks as potentially independent rather than cumulatively restrictive.",

This suggests a misunderstanding of how variable assignment works: the student may believe variables have different 'roles' (input vs. working) rather than understanding that assignment simply copies the value.

The boundary checks (lines 8-14) are unnecessary given that the subsequent if-else chain already handles all possible integer values correctly.
