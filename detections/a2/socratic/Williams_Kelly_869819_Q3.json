          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, each if statement is an independent decision. The program evaluates the condition of the first if; if it is true, the body runs, and then execution continues to the next statement regardless. The next if is then evaluated afresh, and if its condition is also true, its body will also run. To create a mutually exclusive chain (where at most one branch executes), Java requires an if/else-if/else structure, or explicit returns/breaks. Because the student's model assumes \"first match wins\" automatically for consecutive if statements, they omit the upper bounds on the B, C, and D ranges and rely solely on the >= comparisons and ordering, which in Java does not prevent multiple messages from printing for a single grade.",
