This suggests a potential lack of clarity regarding variable necessity and clean code practices, though it doesn't cause a functional error.",

Declaring an unused variable ('c') wastes a trivial amount of mental effort and makes the code slightly harder to read, but it has no functional impact on the program's output or execution path in this case. The student should only declare variables necessary for computation.",
