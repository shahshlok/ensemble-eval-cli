          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that every condition in an 'else if' structure must independently check both the upper and lower boundaries of the desired range (e.g., 80-89) to guarantee correctness. They are defining absolute ranges within each block, treating the `else if` as if it were a flat series of independent `if` statements, failing to rely on the implied upper bound provided by the previously failed conditions.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student does not fully utilize the sequential nature of the Java 'if-else if' control flow structure. When control reaches an `else if` block, it is guaranteed that the condition of the preceding `if` or `else if` failed. For example, if the 'A' condition failed (grade must be < 90), the 'B' condition only logically needs to check the lower bound (grade >= 80). Explicitly checking the upper limit (`<= 89`) is redundant.",
