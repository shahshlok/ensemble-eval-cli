They do not fully trust or utilize the exclusive nature established by the `else if` structure.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student misunderstands the execution flow of the `if-else if` ladder. In this structure, if a preceding condition is true, subsequent `else if` blocks are skipped entirely. Therefore, once the program reaches `else if (grade >= 80)`, it is guaranteed that the grade is already less than 90 (because the previous check `if (grade >= 90...)` was false). Explicitly checking the upper limit (e.g., `grade <= 89`) is logically redundant and indicates a weak mental model of sequential control flow exclusion.",
