          "conceptual_gap": "The student does not fully rely on the sequential nature of the `if-else if` control flow structure. Once a grade fails the check for 'A' (i.e., it's not >= 90), the program is guaranteed that the grade is less than 90. Therefore, when checking for 'B', only the lower bound (`numeric_grade >= 80`) is absolutely necessary. Explicitly checking the upper bound (`numeric_grade <= 89`) in subsequent `else if` blocks demonstrates a failure to leverage the flow control structure efficiently.",
