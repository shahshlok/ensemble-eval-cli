Therefore, they initialize the condition variable (`currentUserGuessValue`) to a 'dummy' value (0) guaranteed NOT to equal the secret number, solely to ensure the loop body executes at least once.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student's mental model requires manually setting up the loop control variable outside the loop to a value known to satisfy the condition, rather than utilizing iterative structures designed for input-driven loops, such as a `do-while` loop (which checks the condition *after* the first body execution) or using an infinite loop with an explicit `break` condition after the successful guess.",
