The student's mental model seems closer to mathematical interval notation where they might be informally thinking of the range 'up to 5' as including 5, rather than recognizing that `< 5` defines a half-open range [1, 5) that excludes 5. The gap is in understanding that the loop condition is checked before each iteration and that the relational operator strictly determines which counter values are included.",
