They treat each 'else if' as an independent, fully bordered condition.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java's operational model, the 'else if' structure guarantees mutual exclusivity. If the program reaches an 'else if', it is already assured that all preceding conditions failed. Therefore, checking the upper limit derived from the previous (higher) range is logically redundant. For example, in the B grade check, knowing that the A check failed (grade < 90) means `&& grade < a` is unnecessary. This indicates the student doesn't fully utilize the filtering power inherent in the sequential 'if-else if' ladder.",
