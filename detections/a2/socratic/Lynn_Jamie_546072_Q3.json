In their mind, the structure is: if 90+ \u2192 A, else if 80+ \u2192 B, else if 70+ \u2192 C, else if 60+ \u2192 (if 65+ then D, else still in the 60\u201369 range), else (<60) \u2192 F.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, `else` always pairs with the closest preceding unmatched `if`, regardless of indentation or line breaks. Because there are no braces, the `else` with `System.out.println(\"Letter grade: F\");` is actually bound to the inner `if (n >= 65)` rather than to `else if (n >= 60)`. The real control flow is: if 90+ \u2192 A; else if 80+ \u2192 B; else if 70+ \u2192 C; else if 60+ then (if 65+ \u2192 D, else \u2192 F); and there is no final `else` that covers `n < 60`. This means grades 60\u201364, which the student likely intended to map to D with the outer `else if (n >= 60)`, are actually routed to the inner `else` and get F instead. The gap is between the student\u2019s indentation-based mental model of block structure and Java\u2019s actual syntax rules requiring braces `{}` to define multi-statement blocks and determining `else` binding purely by nesting, not by visual layout.",
