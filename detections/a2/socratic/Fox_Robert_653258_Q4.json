          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, boolean expressions follow strict logical rules: `A || B` is true if either A or B is true. The expression `x != 0 || x == 0` covers all possible values of `x` and is therefore a tautology (always true). As a result, the `if` statements using these conditions do not actually guard or filter anything; they will always execute their bodies. The student appears to be missing the idea that conditions should be written to distinguish *some* states from others, not just restate a logical fact that is always true. They may also be unclear that `while (row_index <= height_holder)` already fully controls whether the loop body runs, including the case where `height_holder` is `0`, so no extra `if` is needed.",
