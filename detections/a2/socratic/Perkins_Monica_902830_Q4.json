This is done to ensure the original variable (e.g., the input height or the row index) remains safe, clear, and unmodified in case downstream operations or logic inadvertently affect it, demonstrating a weak grasp of variable scope and immutability for primitive types.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, primitive types like `int` are managed efficiently. Creating a variable `triangleHeight` that shadows `userInputHeight` or creating `numberOfStarsInCurrentRow` that shadows `currentRowNumber` is unnecessary redundancy. Since these are primitives, the assignment creates a true copy of the value. Because they are not modified within the inner scope in a destructive manner that would affect the outer scope variable, the repeated assignment is purely stylistic and not necessary for 'safety' or computational clarity, which the student explicitly cites in the surrounding comments.",

Consequently, when execution reaches L31, `numberOfStarsInCurrentRow` (which equals `currentRowNumber`) is guaranteed to be 1 or greater. The check `if (numberOfStarsInCurrentRow > 0)` is logically redundant and shows a misunderstanding of how loop invariants and boundary conditions established earlier in the code propagate downwards.",

They think that storing a value in a new variable makes it 'safer' and that checking if a positive number is greater than 0 is a necessary precaution before using it.",
          "conceptual_gap": "While defensive programming has its place, the student appears to misunderstand when it's actually needed. In this case, the check `if (numberOfStarsInCurrentRow > 0)` is unnecessary because `currentRowNumber` starts at 1 and only increments, so `numberOfStarsInCurrentRow` will always be positive in the loop. The student seems to believe that explicit checks prevent errors, when in reality the program logic already guarantees the condition.
