          "conceptual_gap": "The Java execution model guarantees that an `else if` branch is only executed if all preceding conditions failed. Since the conditions are ordered from highest grade (>=90) down, when evaluating `grade >= 80`, the fact that the program reached this check already guarantees that `grade < 90`. Explicitly checking `grade <= 89` is logically redundant and indicates a misunderstanding or distrust of the exclusionary guarantee provided by the `else if` control structure.",
