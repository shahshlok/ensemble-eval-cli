Incrementing currentRowNumber inside the inner loop means the inner loop's condition currentStarCount <= currentRowNumber keeps changing during the same row, and the outer loop's progress is also being altered. The student is treating currentRowNumber as if it were a separate conceptual 'row counter' that can be tweaked for the pattern, rather than recognizing that the for-header already manages it and that modifying it inside the inner loop changes the program's control flow immediately, leading to non-termination.",

In a nested loop, the inner loop should use the outer loop's current value as a fixed limit for that row. Changing the outer loop's counter inside the inner loop alters the outer loop's behavior in an uncontrolled way: it affects both the remaining iterations of the inner loop (because the condition currentStarCount <= currentRowNumber now compares against a changing value) and the number of outer loop iterations (because the next outer-loop increment will start from this modified value). The correct mental model is that the outer loop decides how many times each row runs, and the inner loop decides how many stars to print for that specific row using the current, stable value of the row index; you do not manually bump the row index for each star.",
