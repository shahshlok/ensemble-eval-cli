          "student_thought_process": "The student believes it is necessary or good practice to duplicate the value of one variable into another immediately after initialization, perhaps due to viewing the instruction 'int height = n;' as assigning a lasting identifier/meaning ('height') to the raw data ('n') even though 'n' itself is not reused or modified in a meaningful way later.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, assigning `int height = n;` simply copies the value presently stored in `n` into `height`. Since `n` is never used again after this line, and `n` itself is not modified, the variable `height` is entirely redundant. The structure of the code would be identical and simpler if `height` was used directly in the `int height = scanner.nextInt();` assignment, or if `n` was used throughout the loop. This suggests a misunderstanding of variable necessity or a cautious, but unnecessary, preservation of the raw input value.",
