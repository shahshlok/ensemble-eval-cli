In other words, they are treating the loop range like a math interval [a, b] whose length is `b - a + 1`, and expect that putting this `c` into `row < c` will make the loop execute once for each integer from 1 through `height`.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In mathematics, the number of integers in the inclusive interval [a, b] is `b - a + 1`. In Java, however, a `for` loop of the form `for (int i = start; i < end; i++)` runs for all `i` from `start` up to but *not including* `end`, and the number of iterations is `end - start`. So if the student wants rows 1 through `height` inclusive, they must either (1) use `for (int row = 1; row <= height; row++)`, or (2) use a half-open range directly, such as `for (int row = 0; row < height; row++)`. By computing `c = b - a + 1` and then using `row < c`, they are mixing the math formula for count of integers with Java's half-open loop condition, resulting in one fewer iteration than intended.",
