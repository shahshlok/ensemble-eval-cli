          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, `*` and `/` have the same precedence and are evaluated left-to-right, so `y/n*z` is `(y/n)*z`. That happens to match the intended formula here, but the underlying mental model risk is that if the formula were slightly different (e.g., `y/(n*z)`), Java would not \"infer\" the intended grouping. Java strictly follows precedence + associativity rules; it doesn\u2019t understand the story problem\u2014only the exact operators and parentheses you write.",
          "error_manifestation": "Often manifests as wrong numeric results when the intended grouping differs from Java\u2019s default grouping; in this specific code, it likely produces the expected value, but the potential misconception is about how Java decides the order of operations.",

Java does `*` and `/` left-to-right, so `y/n*z` means `(y/n)*z`.\n- **String concatenation vs arithmetic**: Without parentheses, Java might concatenate earlier than you expect (e.g., `\"$\" + y/n*z` is still okay due to precedence, but `\"$\" + y / n` can mislead beginners).
