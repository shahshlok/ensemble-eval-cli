When `distance` is assigned the value 0 on line 4, and then `a = distance` is executed on line 9, variable `a` receives a copy of that 0. Later, when `distance = input.nextDouble()` updates `distance` to a new value (like 155), this does not affect `a` because they are now independent storage locations. Similarly, `cost` is calculated once on line 14 and is never recalculated, even though the variables it depends on are updated later.",
