They may also believe that this approach handles all cases without explicitly assigning the result in all branches.",

While this happens to work for the given test case (since t != 0), the mental model suggests the student doesn't fully understand that the initialization value 0 is arbitrary and only works when the condition is true. In cases where t == 0, the output would be 0 (implying no acceleration) rather than indicating an error or undefined result. The student appears to treat 0 as a 'safe' default rather than recognizing it as a mathematical placeholder that may be misleading.",
