Many decimal fractions cannot be represented exactly in binary, so operations can introduce tiny rounding differences. Also, `System.out.println(\"...\" + cost)` uses the default string conversion for `double`, which does not enforce a specific number of decimal places. If the expected output requires rounding (e.g., 2 decimals), the program must explicitly format the value (e.g., `System.out.printf(\"%.2f\", cost)`).",
