They think that as long as they read values from the scanner in the correct order and perform the correct mathematical operations, the variable names used can be arbitrary\u2014mixing x1/y1_val and x2_val/y2 doesn't matter because the values themselves are correct.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student fails to understand that variable names in Java are identifiers that must map consistently to the conceptual data they represent. While the code will compile and run, the mismatched naming (x1 paired with y1_val, then x2_val paired with y2) creates a semantic error where the correspondence between coordinate pairs is broken. The first point should use x1 and y1, and the second should use x2 and y2. Here, y1_val is read as the second input but the calculation uses x1 (first input) and y1_val (second input) for the first point, then x2_val (third input) and y2 (fourth input) for the second point. This inconsistency means the calculation is mathematically correct in form but logically incorrect in intent, creating confusion about which coordinate belongs to which point.",
          "error_manifestation": "The code produces incorrect output because the variable names don't match their logical roles. Although the mathematical formula is applied correctly (sqrt(dx\u00b2 + dy\u00b2)), the mapping between input values and coordinate points is broken. The calculation effectively computes the distance using x1 and y1_val for point 1, and x2_val and y2 for point 2, which works by coincidence in execution but violates the semantic structure intended by the problem.",
