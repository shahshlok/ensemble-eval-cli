          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, `-` and `/` follow operator precedence rules (`/` before `-`), so `v1 - v0 / t` would compute `v1 - (v0/t)`, which is different from `(v1 - v0)/t`. The student\u2019s code avoids this by splitting into two statements, but the underlying misconception commonly appears when students try to write it as a single expression without parentheses. This is a mental-model gap about how Java evaluates expressions and the necessity of parentheses to match mathematical grouping.",
