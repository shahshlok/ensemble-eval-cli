          "conceptual_gap": "The student has a flawed mental model of how Scanner.nextDouble() works. The nextDouble() method reads a single token from the input stream and attempts to parse it as a double. When the user enters '00', it is treated as a single token representing the number 0.0, not as two separate coordinates. The student should prompt separately for each coordinate or parse the input differently (e.g., using string splitting or separate input prompts). The sample run shows the user entering coordinates in the format 'xy' on a single line, but the code attempts to read two doubles per coordinate, which requires two separate whitespace-separated tokens from the user.",
          "error_manifestation": "The program will not produce the expected output from the sample run. When the user enters '00' at the '(x1, y1):' prompt, Scanner.nextDouble() will read it as 0.0 for both x and y due to how the input is actually tokenized, or it may fail if the format doesn't match expectations. The program expects input in the format 'x y' (space-separated) rather than 'xy' (concatenated), which contradicts the sample run.",

More critically, the student should have tested the logic mentally or verified the sample run produces 12.5. For the sample input (0,0), (5,0), (0,5), the correct distances should be 5, sqrt(50), and 5, giving s = (5 + sqrt(50) + 5)/2 \u2248 7.035, and area \u2248 12.5.
