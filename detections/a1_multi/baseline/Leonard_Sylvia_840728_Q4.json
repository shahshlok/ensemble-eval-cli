They assume that because they have assigned two variables, the computer will automatically split the input '00' into '0' and '0'.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, the `Scanner.nextDouble()` method identifies tokens based on whitespace delimiters (such as spaces, tabs, or newlines). A continuous sequence of characters like '50' is treated as a single token representing one numeric value (50.0). The scanner will not 'split' a single numeric token into multiple values to satisfy sequential calls; instead, the first variable will consume the whole token and the second call will block program execution while waiting for further input.",
          "error_manifestation": "The program will fail to produce the correct area for the sample input provided. Specifically, it will assign '00' to x1, '50' to y1, and '05' to x2, eventually running out of input or calculating incorrect side lengths, leading to a wrong area or a runtime 'no such element' exception.",

The input \"00\" is a single token (the number 0), not two tokens (0 and 0). So the program requires input like `0 0` (or `0\\n0`) for each point. If the assessment/test input literally provides `00`, the second `nextDouble()` for `y` will block waiting for another number (or the program may fail if the input ends).",
