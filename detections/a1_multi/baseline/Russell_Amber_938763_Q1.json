More importantly, the problem statement does not specify any special-case behavior for t = 0, so inserting a default value changes the program\u2019s semantics and can produce an incorrect result for that input.

Instead, the student's mental model suggests that n should remain at its initialized value (0) unless explicitly overwritten. This indicates a misunderstanding of variable assignment and conditional execution\u2014the student may conflate the initialization with a fallback value rather than recognizing it as preparatory code for a conditional assignment.",
          "error_manifestation": "The code produces incorrect output. When t=1.5, the condition t!=0 is true, so n=y/t should execute. However, the logic pattern suggests the student is thinking defensively rather than correctly, which works in this case but reveals flawed reasoning. For the given sample input (3 30.4 1.5), the code will calculate: y = 30.4 - 3 = 27.4, and n = 27.4 / 1.5 = 18.266..., which matches the expected output. However, the conceptual error lies in the unnecessary initialization and conditional\u2014the student should recognize that t will never be 0 in a well-posed problem, or handle edge cases more thoughtfully.",
