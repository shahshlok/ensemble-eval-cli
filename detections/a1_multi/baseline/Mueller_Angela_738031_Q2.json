          "conceptual_gap": "The correct reasoning is: gallonsUsed = distance / milesPerGallon, then cost = gallonsUsed * pricePerGallon. In Java, `a/b*c` is evaluated left-to-right with `/` and `*` having the same precedence, so it becomes `(a/b)*c`, which matches the correct unit analysis. There is no actual bug here; however, if the student had assumed a different grouping like `a/(b*c)` that would be incorrect. This code happens to implement the correct formula.",
