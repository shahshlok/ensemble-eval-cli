          "conceptual_gap": "The actual program requirement is to compute the road-trip cost from the three inputs. Silently outputting $0.0 when mpg is 0 (or extremely close to 0) changes the semantics of the computation and can produce a misleading result rather than addressing the invalid input case (e.g., rejecting input, re-prompting, or indicating an error).
