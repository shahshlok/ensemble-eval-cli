          "conceptual_gap": "Java will evaluate `y/n*z` left-to-right for `*` and `/` (same precedence), yielding `(y/n)*z`. This is only correct if the intended cost formula is gallonsUsed = distance / mpg; cost = gallonsUsed * pricePerGallon. If the problem expected a different relationship (e.g., inputs in different units, or price per mile), this expression would be wrong. In this particular problem statement/sample, the intended formula is indeed `(distance/mpg)*price`, so the code\u2019s arithmetic model matches the requirement.",
