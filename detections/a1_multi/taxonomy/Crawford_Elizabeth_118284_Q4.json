Specifically, they believe the computer 'knows' how to split a single contiguous input string like '00' into two separate numerical values (x and y) because the prompt labels them as a pair '(x1, y1)'.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student fails to recognize that the Java Scanner is a simple whitespace-delimited tokenizer that operates independently of any output text. It cannot 'see' the prompt labels to determine how to split tokens or ignore punctuation (like commas or parentheses) unless explicit instructions (like useDelimiter) are provided.",
          "error_manifestation": "The program will either hang while waiting for a second token that the user (following the sample run's '00' format) hasn't entered, or throw an InputMismatchException if the user includes the punctuation shown in the prompt label.",
