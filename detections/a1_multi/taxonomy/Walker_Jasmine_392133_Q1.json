While a user typing exactly `0` will usually be read as exactly `0.0` (so this check works for that case), equality/inequality comparisons on doubles can be brittle in general because values that are \u201cmathematically zero\u201d may be represented as very small nonzero numbers (or vice versa after computation). A more robust mental model is: floating-point comparisons often need a tolerance (epsilon) when values come from calculations, and you should also consider what to do for extremely small `t` (which can still produce absurdly large acceleration).",
