          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, `double` values are stored in binary floating-point, so many decimal values cannot be represented exactly. As a result, equality/inequality comparisons can be unreliable for most computed or parsed-from-text floating-point values (you often need a tolerance/epsilon). In this specific program, checking against exactly `0.0` for user input is usually fine, but the pattern suggests the student may generalize this to other floating-point comparisons where it will fail.",
