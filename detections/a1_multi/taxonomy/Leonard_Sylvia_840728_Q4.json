          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that the computer 'reads' and understands the visual layout of the print prompt (e.g., '(x1, y1):') to determine how to parse input. They assume that if they ask for two variables in a specific format, the computer will automatically know how to separate the user's input (like '00') into those two variables based on that request.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student's mental model assumes a link between what is printed to the console (System.out) and how the computer parses incoming characters (System.in). In reality, the Scanner operates independently of the output stream and relies on whitespace delimiters to identify numeric tokens; it cannot 'see' the prompt to understand that '00' should be split into two separate 0.0 values.",
          "error_manifestation": "If the user follows the prompt's suggested format literally (e.g., typing '00' as shown in the sample run or including parentheses), the Scanner will fail to find two distinct double values. It will either treat '00' as a single '0.0' and hang while waiting for the second input, or throw an InputMismatchException if it encounters punctuation like commas or parentheses.",
