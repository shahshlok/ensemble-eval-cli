          "conceptual_gap": "There isn\u2019t a gap here: this is the correct Java execution model for an in-place right shift.

By using the 'n' variable for all bounds checks and indexing, the student demonstrates a mental model where the array and its size are separate, 'parallel' entities. While functionally correct in this context, this model fails to leverage the object-oriented nature of Java arrays, where the array instance is the single source of truth for its own capacity.",
