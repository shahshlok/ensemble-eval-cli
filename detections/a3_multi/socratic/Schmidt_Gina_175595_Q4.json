          "conceptual_gap": "There isn\u2019t an apparent gap here: this matches Java\u2019s execution model (explicit assignment, explicit indexing, and careful loop direction to avoid overwriting). The prompts are used only for user interaction; the code does not rely on the computer 'understanding' them. Variables are updated only via assignments, not automatically. No operator-misuse (^), no surprising type conversions, and no reliance on methods mutating arguments in place are present.",
