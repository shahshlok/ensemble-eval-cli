          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, arrays are objects that encapsulate their own size within a 'length' property (e.g., y.length). The student's mental model treats the array more like a primitive C-style pointer that lacks intrinsic knowledge of its boundaries, leading to a redundant reliance on an external tracking variable.",
          "error_manifestation": "While this program functions correctly, this belief leads to 'state synchronization' risks where the tracking variable 'n' might be updated while the array size remains the same (or vice versa), often resulting in ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsExceptions in larger, more complex systems.",
