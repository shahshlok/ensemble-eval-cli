          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, `String` objects are immutable: methods such as `toUpperCase()` and `replace(...)` do not modify the original String object. They compute and return a *new* String. If you don\u2019t assign the return value, the original reference still points to the unchanged String.",
          "error_manifestation": "Often manifests as \"nothing changed\" output when students call `input_line.toUpperCase();` or `input_line.replace(...);` without assignment. In this specific code, the student avoided the bug by assigning to new variables, but the presence of the note in the prompt and the multi-step reassignment pattern are common indicators that this was a point of uncertainty.",
