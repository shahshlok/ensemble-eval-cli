          "conceptual_gap": "In the Java notional machine, output and input streams are independent. The print statement simply adds characters to the output buffer, while nextInt() only pauses execution if the input buffer is empty. If the user provides multiple inputs at once, the program will consume them without pausing at the intermediate prompts.",
          "error_manifestation": "This belief leads to confusion when the program is run with redirected input or when users type ahead, as the 'waiting' behavior does not match the prompt sequence.",
