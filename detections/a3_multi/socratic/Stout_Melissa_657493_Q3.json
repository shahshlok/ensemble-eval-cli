          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that calling methods like `toUpperCase()` and `replace(...)` will directly change the original `input` string, so after those calls, `input` itself would now be uppercase and have underscores.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, `String` objects are immutable: methods such as `toUpperCase()` and `replace(...)` do not modify the existing `String` in memory. Instead, they create and return a *new* `String`. If you don\u2019t store the returned value, the original string remains unchanged. The student\u2019s code actually handles this correctly by saving into `upper` and then `result`, but the presence of the note in the prompt and the pattern of method use is a common place where beginners mistakenly expect mutation.",
          "error_manifestation": "If the student had written `input.toUpperCase(); input.replace(' ', '_');` and then printed `input`, the output would remain the original text (wrong output). In this submission, no error occurs because they reassigned to new variables.",
