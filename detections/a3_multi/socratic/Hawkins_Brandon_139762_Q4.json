          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that adding detailed English comments explaining each step of the program is equivalent to writing clear, maintainable code. The student appears to think that by labeling each line with a descriptive comment (Step 1, Step 2, etc.), the code becomes self-documenting and easier to understand.",
          "conceptual_gap": "While comments can be helpful, this student has misunderstood their purpose. Comments should explain *why* code does something or clarify non-obvious logic, not simply restate what the code obviously does. The student seems to believe that detailed step-by-step narration compensates for less readable code structure. In reality, good Java code should be readable without comments through clear variable names, logical flow, and proper formatting. The excessive commenting here suggests the student may not fully trust that the code speaks for itself.",
          "error_manifestation": "No runtime or compile error, but code maintainability and readability are compromised. The comments outnumber the actual logic, which can obscure rather than clarify. This reflects a misconception about code documentation practices rather than Java semantics.",
