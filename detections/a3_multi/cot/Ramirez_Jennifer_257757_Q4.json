There is no requirement for a named variable to hold a value during transfer. For example, 'arr[i] = sc.nextInt()' or 'System.out.print(arr[j])' are perfectly valid and perform the same action as the student's multi-line approach more concisely.",

          "conceptual_gap": "In Java's notional machine, the right-hand side of an assignment is fully evaluated to a value before the assignment to the left-hand side occurs. Therefore, 'arr_numbers[index] = arr_numbers[index - 1]' is perfectly safe and atomic in terms of value transfer; the intermediate 'holder' variable is unnecessary. Similarly, 'arr_numbers[i] = sc.nextInt()' is valid as the method call evaluates to a primitive value before storage.",
