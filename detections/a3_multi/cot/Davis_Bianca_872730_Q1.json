          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, Scanner.hasNextInt() does not consume input and does not prompt or block until valid input appears; it only *checks* whether the next token can be parsed as an int. If the next token is not an int, hasNextInt() returns false and the token remains in the input buffer. In this code, when hasNextInt() is false, the program still advances the array index (or continues), silently storing the default 0 and moving on. This causes incorrect array contents/target and can also leave the bad token unread, which can cascade into repeated failures on subsequent checks.",
