Furthermore, they believe these variables are ephemeral and tied only to the logic of the comparison, as they do not reuse them to perform the swap, instead choosing to re-access the array to fetch the same values again.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In the Java notional machine, an array access expression (e.g., arr[i]) is a first-class expression that evaluates to a value. This value can be used directly as an operand for any operator, including comparison operators. Additionally, local variables are persistent within their scope; once a value is stored in 'a', it remains available for the swap logic, making redundant array lookups unnecessary.",
