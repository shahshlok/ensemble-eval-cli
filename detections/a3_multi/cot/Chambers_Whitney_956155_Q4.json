          "conceptual_gap": "In Java's execution model, the Right-Hand Side (RHS) of an assignment is fully evaluated to a value before it is stored in the Left-Hand Side (LHS). Consequently, expressions like 'y[i] = x.nextInt()' or 'y[j] = y[j-1]' are safe and standard. The student's model assumes a more 'physical' movement where a value needs a temporary 'holding area' during the transition.",
