Specifically, they believe that the computer knows to 'look' for names only after the 'Enter names' prompt and for scores only after the 'Enter scores' prompt, and that the computer will distinguish between these data types based on the programmer's intent.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student fails to realize that Java's Scanner is independent of the System.out stream. The input stream is one continuous sequence of tokens; the Scanner simply consumes the next available token regardless of what was just printed. By using two separate loops to read all names and then all scores, the student has created a fragile system that assumes the user will perfectly follow a block-entry pattern (all names then all scores) rather than a more natural entry pattern (one name followed by one score).",
