          "conceptual_gap": "In Java's Scanner, methods like hasNext() and hasNextInt() are blocking operations when used with System.in. They do not return false simply because the user hasn't typed anything yet; instead, the program pauses and waits for the user to provide a token or for the input stream to be closed (EOF). This makes the 'else' logic for default values unreachable during normal interactive use.",
          "error_manifestation": "When the program is run interactively, it will hang and wait for input at the 'if' condition rather than executing the 'else' branch if the user leaves a field blank.",

          "error_manifestation": "If a user enters a non-integer (e.g., a name) where an integer score is expected, the loop will effectively 'freeze' on that token, and every remaining score in the array will be set to 0 without further reading from the user.",
