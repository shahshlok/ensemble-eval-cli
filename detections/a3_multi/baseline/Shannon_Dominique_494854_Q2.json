          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, the == operator compares object references, not string content. For String objects, comparing with == checks if both variables point to the same object in memory. The student should use the .equals() method or .isEmpty() to compare string values. However, in this specific case, the check is actually correct because the student is comparing against the null reference (a special singleton), so this works by accident. The deeper misconception is not recognizing the difference between reference equality and value equality.",
