They think printing `-1` alone is the correct way to indicate 'not found', while printing 'Found at index: X' is only for when the element is actually found.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student has misunderstood the problem specification. The problem asks to 'print -1' if not found, but this should ideally maintain consistent output formatting. More fundamentally, the student seems to believe that different output formats are acceptable for different cases without considering whether the caller/tester expects a uniform, predictable output structure. In professional/testing contexts, inconsistent output formats create ambiguity.",
