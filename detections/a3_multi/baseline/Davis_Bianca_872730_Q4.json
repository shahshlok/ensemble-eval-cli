          "conceptual_gap": "The program\u2019s correctness includes handling boundary cases consistently with the stated problem/output format. Here, the shifting logic is guarded by `if(n!=0)`, so for `n==0` the program prints `Shifted: ` and then stops without printing an empty line or any elements. Depending on the grader/spec, this may be considered incomplete output (often expected to still show an empty result line). This is not a Java execution-model issue, but a logic/requirements interpretation gap about output for edge cases.",
