Upon closer inspection, the code is actually correct: after sorting in ascending order, the largest value IS at the end. The student's mental model here is sound. However, the problem statement asks to 'sort the data based on scores in ascending order' and then 'print the name and score of the student with the highest score.' The code does exactly this\u2014it sorts in ascending order and prints the student at position n-1. This is logically correct.",
