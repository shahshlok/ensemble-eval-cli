The student appears to misunderstand that these methods are guaranteed to return a valid String. Additionally, the student checks if 'y' (from nextLine()) is null, but nextLine() will throw an exception rather than return null if no input is available. This suggests confusion about Java's null-returning contract for different methods.",
