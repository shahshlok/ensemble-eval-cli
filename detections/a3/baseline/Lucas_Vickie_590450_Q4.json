In Java, `x[i] = x[i-1]` is generally sufficient for a backward shift *if* the loop traverses correctly (i=N-1 down to 1). The introduction of the redundant temporary variable `u = x[i-1]` on line 21, coupled with the flawed belief that this temporary save is necessary to protect the original value (which is already protected by the order of assignment), suggests a hesitation or confusion about direct assignment, although in this specific implementation, it does not cause an error because `x[i-1]` is read immediately before being overwritten in the next step.",
