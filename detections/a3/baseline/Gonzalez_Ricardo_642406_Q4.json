          "description": "The student solved a completely different problem. Instead of reading a single integer height N and printing a pattern of asterisks in a right triangle shape, the student implemented a triangle area calculator that reads three coordinate points and computes the area using Heron's formula.",
          "severity": "critical",
          "category": "conceptual",
          "student_belief": "The student appears to believe that Q4 is asking for a program that calculates the area of a triangle given three coordinate points.",
          "correct_understanding": "Q4 asks for a program that: (1) reads a single integer N representing height, (2) uses nested loops to print N rows, (3) prints i asterisks on row i (where i goes from 1 to N), (4) outputs a right triangle pattern of asterisks, not a numerical calculation.",
          "symptoms": [
            "Program reads three coordinate pairs instead of one height value",
            "Output is a numerical area value, not a pattern of asterisks",
            "No nested loop structure for row iteration and star printing",
            "Includes unnecessary geometric distance calculations and Heron's formula"
          ],
          "root_cause": "The student appears to have confused this assignment with a different problem (likely from earlier in the course or a different question). The class name 'Q4TriangleArea' suggests the student was thinking about area calculations rather than pattern printing.",
          "remediation_hint": "Re-read the problem statement carefully. Q4 requires pattern printing, not geometric calculations. Write pseudo-code first: for each row from 1 to N, print i asterisks, then move to the next line.",

          "confidence": 0.99,
          "confidence_rationale": "Nearly certain because the student's code solves a completely different problem with different input/output. The problem statement is clear and unambiguous about requesting a pattern-printing program, while the code implements geometric calculations.",
