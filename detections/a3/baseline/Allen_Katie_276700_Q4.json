          "description": "The student misunderstood the assignment requirements entirely. The task asks for a pattern-printing program using loops to create a right triangle of asterisks. Instead, the student implemented a mathematical algorithm to calculate the area of a triangle given coordinates using Heron's formula.",

          "student_belief": "The student appears to believe the assignment is asking them to calculate the area of a triangle given three coordinate points, or they have submitted code from a completely different assignment.",
