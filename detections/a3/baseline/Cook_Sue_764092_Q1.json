          "conceptual_gap": "The conceptual gap is not in the code's output logic itself, as it correctly finds and prints the 0-based index. However, the use of `break` *correctly* solves the problem of finding the *first* occurrence. If the student had *not* used `break` (a common mistake), they would be finding the *last* occurrence.
