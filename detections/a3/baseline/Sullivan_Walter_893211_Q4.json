While functionally correct, reusing 'i' for three separate purposes (input index, reverse shift index, output index) demonstrates a failure to employ structured programming principles where variables should ideally reflect their unique logical roles for clarity and maintainability, suggesting an incomplete mental model of variable lifecycle and code readability standards.",
