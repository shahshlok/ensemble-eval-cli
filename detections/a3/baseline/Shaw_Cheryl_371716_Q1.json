          "conceptual_gap": "The student correctly uses `break` to exit the loop after finding the target. However, the initialization of the index variable to -1 is crucial for the 'not found' case. If the target is found, the index is correctly updated and the loop terminates. If the student had misunderstood how the `break` works (e.g., if they believed execution continued after the finding the target), this would be a different error, but here the logic is sound because `index = -1` acts as the default 'not found' value, and it is only overridden by the *first* hit due to `break`. The code is actually logically correct for the defined problem.",
