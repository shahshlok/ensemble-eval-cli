This reflects a lack of trust in Java's strict order of operation evaluation for simple assignments.",
          "conceptual_gap": "Java strictly evaluates the right-hand side of an assignment operator completely before the assignment to the left-hand side occurs. Therefore, `arr[i] = arr[i - 1]` reads the value of `arr[i - 1]` reliably before modifying `arr[i]`. The introduction of the temporary variable `a` is redundant and unnecessary for correctness or defensive programming in this context.",

However, the loop copies arr[i-1] \u2192 arr[i], which is correct directionally. The actual issue is more subtle: the student is correctly implementing the shift logic, but the code execution appears sound for the given problem. Upon careful trace: storing last=arr[3]=4, then i=3: arr[3]=arr[2]=3, i=2: arr[2]=arr[1]=2, i=1: arr[1]=arr[0]=1, then arr[0]=4 gives [4,1,2,3]. This is actually CORRECT.

A conceptual gap exists in not recognizing standard, simpler printing patterns (like printing the elements, then printing the final space or newline outside the loop, or using `Arrays.toString()` which is not applicable here, but common for professional solutions). The specific logic error here is that the student prints the space *before* checking the condition, which is slightly inefficient. More critically, the problem statement provides a Sample Run which uses spaces, but the student's required function is complete and correct for the task, indicating a working, but inelegant, solution for output formatting.",
