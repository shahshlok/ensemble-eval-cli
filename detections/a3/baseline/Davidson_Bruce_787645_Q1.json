The use of `break` ensures that the loop stops at that match, making any additional check to confirm `if (firstOccurrenceIndex == -1)` unnecessary and overly cautious. The correct and simplest approach is to assign the index and then break, relying on the sequential nature of the `while` loop.",

The correct action upon finding a match is to record the index and immediately terminate the loop. The student's code unnecessarily checks if `firstOccurrenceIndex` is still `-1` (Line 41) before assigning the current index (Line 42), and then terminates the loop (Line 44) regardless of the previous check. This `if (firstOccurrenceIndex == -1)` block is redundant because the `break` statement ensures the loop only executes the match-handling code once, making the outer conditional check sufficient on its own.",
