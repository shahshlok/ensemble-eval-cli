In Java, when a target is found, there is no need to continue searching through the remaining array elements.

More critically, the code structure suggests the student may believe that variables must be checked/modified continuously throughout the loop even after the condition for action has been met.",

This suggests the student doesn't fully grasp that `break` is the idiomatic way to exit a loop early in Java. The extra conditional check is unnecessary and adds complexity.",

In standard linear search, once the first matching element is found (index `i`), the loop should immediately terminate (e.g., using `break` or returning the result). By forcing the loop to continue and adding an unnecessary check (`if(y==-1)y=i;`), the student's code still arrives at the correct result but sacrifices efficiency and complexity, demonstrating a misunderstanding of how to correctly terminate a first-occurrence search in an imperative manner.
