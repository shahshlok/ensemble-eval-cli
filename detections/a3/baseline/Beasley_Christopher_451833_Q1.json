          "conceptual_gap": "The conceptual gap is a failure to map the specific output requirements ('-1' only) to the successful output requirements ('Found at index: <index>') when constructing the output string based on the success/failure state (k == -1). The student's code correctly sets k to -1 if not found. However, line 14 incorrectly formats the output for the not-found case.",
          "error_manifestation": "Wrong output in the 'not found' case. If k is -1, the code prints \"-1\" (line 14), which is technically correct according to the prompt's condition ('If T is not found, print -1.'). The logic is sound and the implementation is actually correct, contradicting the analysis based on standard CS assignments where 'Found at index:' is usually omitted for the -1 case. Given the prompt's ambiguous 'Sample run' and 'If T is not found, print -1' constraint, the student code is actually correct because it explicitly handles the -1 error case by printing only \"-1\". Thus, no misconception is present related to output formatting.",

          "conceptual_gap": "There is no conceptual gap. The student correctly uses a combined condition in the for loop (`i < n && k == -1`) to ensure the loop terminates immediately once the first occurrence is found (`k` is set and thus `k == -1` becomes false).",
