They might view the `Found at index: ` part as required 'flavor' text, while the problem intended for a single, unified output format for both success and failure states, or simply missed the distinction in the prompt's negative case.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student failed to precisely model the output requirements based on the prompt's specification. The requirement was: 'Print the index... If T is not found, print -1.' The sample run showed 'Found at index: 1'. When T is not found, the requirement is to print *only* '-1'. The student correctly prints -1 (line 30), but when found, they print a longer string (line 32) instead of just the index number, suggesting a failure to generalize the required output structure based on the prompt's instruction versus the sample run's flavoring.",
