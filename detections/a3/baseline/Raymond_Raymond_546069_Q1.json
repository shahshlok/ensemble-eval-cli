The variables `b` (initialized to `N`) and `c` (initialized to `N`) are unnecessary aliases for `N`. The standard and correct approach is simply `while (i < N)` or `for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)`.",

The student may believe that loops require explicit computation of range endpoints, or they may be confused about how to properly reference array dimensions.",

The actual Java execution model requires only the array length (`N`) and the loop index (`i`).
