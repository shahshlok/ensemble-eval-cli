Setting `i = n` within the loop body does NOT prevent the loop increment expression (`i++`) from executing after each iteration. After setting `i = n`, the loop will increment `i` to `n+1`, check if `n+1 < n` (which is false), and then exit. However, this is an inefficient way to break out of a loop. The proper mechanism is to use the `break` statement, which immediately exits the loop without executing the increment expression. The student's mental model suggests they believe the assignment `i = n` has special terminating power, rather than understanding that the loop condition is checked after the increment.",
          "error_manifestation": "The code produces correct output for the given sample input, but the logic is flawed and inefficient. The misconception is masked by the fact that setting `i = n` coincidentally causes the loop condition `i < n` to fail on the next iteration.
