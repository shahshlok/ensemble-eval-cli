          "conceptual_gap": "While the code does technically work correctly for this problem, the pattern suggests the student may not fully understand that initializing `c = -1` directly ensures the 'not found' case is handled. The use of intermediate variables `a`, `b`, and `c` instead of using loop bounds directly (0 to N) and a result variable indicates either over-complication or uncertainty about loop semantics. However, the actual execution is correct: the loop breaks when the target is found, updating `c`, and if never found, `c` remains -1.",

While the student's approach of storing bounds in `a` and `b` is not incorrect, it suggests they may not fully grasp that loop parameters are evaluated at loop entry and don't require pre-assignment to intermediate variables.

          "conceptual_gap": "The student uses variables `a = 0` and `b = N` to define the start and end of the loop, and `c = -1` to track the result. While benign in this specific case, this approach complicates the code without providing any benefit, potentially indicating a conceptual gap in writing minimal, clear code, or a fear of using literal values directly in control structures. The code is logically correct, however, demonstrating a stylistic or structural preference rather than a fundamental error in execution model, but it is a strong anti-pattern in simple procedural code.",
