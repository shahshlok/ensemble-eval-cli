They are also using the required output format for the 'found' case, but failed to notice the separate requirement for the 'not found' case.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The problem specifies that the output should be either 'Found at index: [index]' (for a successful find) or just '-1' (if not found). The student's code prints '-1' when not found, which is correct. However, the requirement is actually: 'Print the index of the first occurrence of T in the array. If T is not found, print -1.' The sample output shows 'Found at index: 1', which might imply a specific format, but the brief prompt suggests only printing the index or -1. The student's code is strictly following the *semantic* intent (index or -1) but uses inconsistent printing logic, deviating slightly from the implicit format needed to match the 'Found at index: 1' sample exactly, and also failing the 'print -1' requirement if the sample output is ignored and only the problem description is followed. Crucially, the student introduces an extra check/logic flow that treats the '-1' case separately instead of universally printing the variable `firstOccurrenceIndex` which already holds the correct result (-1 if not found, index otherwise).",
          "error_manifestation": "Incorrect output format when the target is found, or if the target is not found (depending on interpretation of the prompt vs sample run). The prompt asks to 'Print the index... If T is not found, print -1.' The simplest correct solution is `System.out.println(firstOccurrenceIndex);` after the loop. The student's code produces: If found: 'Found at index: [index]'. If not found: '-1'. A potential issue is that the sample run implies the full 'Found at index:' string is part of the required output for a found element, making the 'not found' case print '-1' without context, which is inconsistent.",

However, the problem specification shows that the output format should be 'Found at index: ' followed by the index when found, and '-1' when not found. The student's code is actually correct for this part, but there's a subtle inconsistency: the else branch should either print 'Found at index: -1' or just '-1'. Looking at the sample output, '-1' alone appears correct. The real issue is that the code correctly handles this, so there may be NO misconception here upon closer inspection.",
