          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that in an array of size 'n', the inner loop of a bubble sort should iterate up to index `n - 1 - i` to compare `j` with `j + 1`, and that the outer loop needs to run `n-1` times to ensure full sorting.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The conceptual gap is the misunderstanding of Bubble Sort loop boundaries, specifically in relation to zero-based indexing and the stopping condition for the comparison within the inner loop. When checking `j` against `j+1`, the index `j` must not exceed `n - 2 - i` to prevent `j+1` from accessing `n-1-i`, which itself might be the last index required for comparison. For an optimization `n - 1 - i`, the inner loop should stop at `j < n - 1 - i` (or `j <= n - 2 - i`). By using `j < n - 1 - i`, the last index accessed by `j` is `n - 2 - i`, and `j + 1` accesses `n - 1 - i`. If the array size `n` is 1, `n-1` is 0, leading to a loop condition failure. If `n=2`, `n-1=1`. The outer loop runs for `i=0`. The inner loop runs for `j < 2 - 1 - 0` (i.e., `j < 1`), so `j=0$. This correctly compares index 0 and 1. The boundaries appear slightly off but *work* for N >= 2. However, if constraints are strict, the loops are often written as `i < N - 1` and `j < N - 1 - i` or `j < N - 1 - i` and comparing `j` to `j+1` is correct. The issue is purely defensive programming/correctness for boundary cases outside of the immediate sorting logic which, in this bubble sort implementation, is technically correct for N >= 2, but typically prone to off-by-one errors in student implementations.",
          "error_manifestation": "The code works correctly for N >= 2 based on standard Bubble Sort implementation patterns, but reflects potential boundary confusion which often leads to Array Index Out Of Bounds errors if the optimization term `n - 1 - i` was misunderstood or incorrectly applied.",

While the problem *requires* sorting the data in ascending order, the ultimate goal is merely to find the maximum score and the corresponding student name. A more efficient algorithm would be to iterate once through the scores while keeping track of the maximum score found so far and its index, avoiding the O(N^2) overhead of a full sort. The student treats the sorting requirement as a necessary intermediate step rather than realizing it's a constraint that dictates the implementation method, which could be satisfied more efficiently if only the maximum was needed.",
