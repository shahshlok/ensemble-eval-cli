They advance 'j' only in the 'else' block (when the target is not found) and set 'j = n' (the loop termination condition) immediately upon finding the target to force an early exit.",
          "conceptual_gap": "While this structure technically achieves the desired outcome (finding the first occurrence and stopping), it shows a lack of familiarity with standard control flow idioms. The preferred methods for early exit are using a 'break' statement or restructuring the logic into a more standard 'for' loop. The student's approach of conditionally controlling the iteration variable 'j' is overly complicated and prone to logic errors in more complex loop structures, revealing an awkward mental model of how loop control flow should be managed.",

While setting j = n does cause the loop condition (j < n) to become false on the next iteration, this is an indirect and unconventional way to exit a loop. The student appears to lack understanding of the `break` statement, which is the proper mechanism for early loop termination in Java. More fundamentally, the student's approach works but reveals they don't recognize that `break` exists for this exact purpose.",
          "error_manifestation": "The code produces correct output, but demonstrates a conceptual gap in understanding proper loop control mechanisms. The logic happens to work: when target is found at index j, the code sets index = j and then j = n, causing the loop to exit. However, this is an anti-pattern that suggests incomplete knowledge of Java's control flow structures.",
