The student interpreted this to mean that when NOT found, the output should be just '-1', rather than 'Found at index: -1' (which would be the more consistent approach). This suggests the student didn't fully consider that the problem asks to 'print the index' which could be -1, and that a consistent output format would enhance clarity.",
