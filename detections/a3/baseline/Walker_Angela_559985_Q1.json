          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that printing the required output ('Found at index: ' + index) is only necessary when a match is found (a != -1), and for the 'not found' case, they should simply print the raw number -1 without any preceding string or label, even though the prompt requires a consistent format or at least a minimal output when not found.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The conceptual gap is a failure to align the specific output formatting requirement of the 'found' case with the 'not found' case, and specifically, forgetting to print the string 'Found at index: ' only when the target is found. The sample output for 'Found at index: 1' implies that the output should include the prefix 'Found at index: ' if a match is made. The student correctly implements this for the success case but fails to realize they should *only* print the variable 'a' (which is -1) when not found, potentially leading to confusion if a specific output format wasn't strictly enforced for the 'not found' case in the prompt, or if the student missed the implicit requirement to output *only* -1 when not found.",
          "error_manifestation": "Incorrect output format when the target is not found (printing just '-1') versus when it is found (printing 'Found at index: 1'). *Self-Correction: The prompt asks to print the index and '-1' if not found. The student's code prints 'Found at index: index' if found, and '-1' if not found. Let's re-read the prompt: 'Print the index of the first occurrence of T in the array. If T is not found, print -1.' The student should either print 'index' or '-1'. The sample run *adds* 'Found at index:'. The student is following the sample run's embellishment for the success case but correctly following the literal prompt for the failure case. This is a subtle error where they mix following the sample run's formatting (success case) and the problem's literal output (failure case). If we strictly follow the problem text, the 'Found at index: ' prefix should not be there for the success case either. Given the sample run, the student's code is likely acceptable *if* the 'Found at index: ' prefix is required/allowed for the success case. However, printing *only* -1 for the failure case is correct according to the prompt 'print -1'. The *only* issue is the inconsistent inclusion of the prefix. The student *does* follow the implicit convention of the sample run for the success case, and the prompt for the failure case. I will mark this as a mild logical/output formatting inconsistency.",

However, the structure suggests the student may not fully understand that they could simplify this or that the logic here is somewhat backwards compared to typical searching patterns.
