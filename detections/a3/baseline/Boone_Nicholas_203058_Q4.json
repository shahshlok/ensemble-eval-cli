          "description": "The student has fundamentally misunderstood the assignment. They appear to have confused 'printing a right triangle pattern' with 'calculating triangle area' (a geometric concept). The entire submission solves a different problem.",

          "category": "conceptual",
          "student_belief": "The student appears to believe that Q4 asks them to calculate the area of a triangle using Heron's formula given three coordinate points.",
          "correct_understanding": "Q4 asks the student to read a single integer N and print an asterisk pattern forming a right triangle with N rows, where row i contains i asterisks. This is a pattern-printing exercise, not a geometric calculation.",
