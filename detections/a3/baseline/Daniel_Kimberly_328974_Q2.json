          "description": "The student implemented a road-trip cost calculator and then added a small fixed-number guessing loop (1\u201310 with answer 7), rather than the specified game where the computer picks a random number between 1 and 100 and the user keeps guessing until correct. There is no use of Random, the range is 1\u201310 instead of 1\u2013100, there is no guess counter, and the interaction text does not match the required behaviour.\n\nRubric impact and feedback:\n- Generating random number (1-100): 0/1 \u2013 No random number is generated; the code uses a constant `int correct_answer = 7;` and the range is 1\u201310 instead of 1\u2013100.\n- Loop for guessing (while/do-while): 0/1 \u2013 There is a while-loop, but it is attached to a different, incorrect mini-game and is logically broken (never reads a new guess inside the loop), so it does not correctly implement repeated guessing for this task.\n- Logic for \"Too high\" hint: 0/1 \u2013 Although there is a \"Too high\" message, it is for the 1\u201310 game, and the overall program is not the requested 1\u2013100 guessing game. No correct implementation for this task.\n- Logic for \"Too low\" hint: 0/1 \u2013 Same as above; there is a \"Too low\" message but not in the correct context or with a working loop.\n- Specific termination condition (correct guess): 0/1 \u2013 The intended program (random 1\u2013100 game) is missing. The existing loop either never terminates (since the guess is never updated) or, if fixed, would still be for the wrong game.\n\nOverall feedback: This submission does not implement the specified number guessing game at all; instead it primarily solves a different problem (road trip cost). To receive marks, you need a standalone program whose main behaviour matches the sample: generate a random number between 1 and 100 using Random, prompt the user repeatedly, print \"Too high\"/\"Too low\" after each wrong guess, count guesses, and finish with a summary of how many guesses were taken.",
