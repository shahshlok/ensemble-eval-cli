          "conceptual_gap": "The student has implemented a bubble sort variant but with inverted logic. When `a > b`, they swap, which should move larger values toward the end. However, the condition `if(a>b)` performs a swap, which is correct for ascending order bubble sort. The actual issue is a misunderstanding of what 'highest score' means in context: the code sorts in ascending order (smallest to largest), placing the maximum at index `n-1`. While this technically works for finding the top student, the problem statement says 'sort based on scores in ascending order' then 'print the student with highest score,' which the code does accomplish. Upon closer inspection, the logic is actually correct for this specific output requirement, but the student may have misunderstood the sorting requirement by thinking ascending order means something different.",

However, the core conceptual flaw is the confusion between what `A > B` swap achieves (ascending order placement) versus what `A < B` swap achieves (descending order placement), manifesting here as an assumption that a partially correct sorting algorithm handles the required order correctly by accessing the last element.",
