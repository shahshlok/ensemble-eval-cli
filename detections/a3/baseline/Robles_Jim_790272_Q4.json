          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that to shift elements to the right, they should iterate from the end of the array backwards and move each element to the right position. They think that processing from right to left (high indices to low indices) will correctly shift all elements rightward.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student has a flawed mental model of the shift operation's mechanics. When shifting right, if you start from the rightmost element and move leftward, you overwrite values before copying them. Specifically, the algorithm processes index 3\u21922\u21921, moving array[2] to array[3], then array[1] to array[2], then array[0] to array[1]. However, this approach works correctly only by accident here because the last element was saved first. The deeper misconception is not understanding that a right shift requires either: (1) iterating from right to left when using a temporary variable (which they do), OR (2) iterating left to right when rotating through a cycle. The student's approach happens to work for this specific problem, but it suggests they don't fully understand why the iteration direction matters or how element movements propagate through the array.",
