          "description": "The submitted program implements an average acceleration calculator using v0, v1, and t instead of a program that reads 5 integers and prints the sum of the even ones. This indicates a misunderstanding or disregard of the given problem specification.\n\nRubric evaluation for this submission:\n1. Reading 5 integers from input (1.0 point): 0/1\n   Feedback: The program reads three double values (v0, v1, t) instead of five integers. It does not match the required input format or quantity.\n\n2. Loop structure to process inputs (1.0 point): 0/1\n   Feedback: There is no loop to process multiple inputs. The solution uses three single reads, so it cannot handle 5 separate integer inputs.\n\n3. Conditional check for even numbers (n % 2 == 0) (1.0 point): 0/1\n   Feedback: The program never checks whether a number is even. There is no use of a modulus operator or any conditional filtering based on parity.\n\n4. Accumulating sum and printing result (1.0 point): 0/1\n   Feedback: Instead of maintaining a running sum of even integers and printing it, the program computes an acceleration value and prints that. No accumulator for even numbers is present.\n\nOverall feedback: The code is syntactically correct and logically consistent for computing average acceleration, but it does not address the assigned task at all. Carefully re-read the problem statement, then design a solution that (1) reads exactly 5 integers, (2) uses a loop to process them, (3) checks each for evenness with n % 2 == 0, and (4) accumulates and prints the sum of the even values.",
