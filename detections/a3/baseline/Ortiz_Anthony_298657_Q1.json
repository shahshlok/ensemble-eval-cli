          "conceptual_gap": "While it is good practice to close resources like `Scanner`, doing so on the `Scanner` connected to the standard input stream (`System.in`) is problematic in standard command-line environments (like JVM termination or automated testing) because `System.in` is a process-level global resource that should generally remain open for the duration of the program, or until the JVM handles its cleanup. Closing the associated `Scanner` also closes the underlying stream, which can lead to subsequent unexpected behavior if other parts of the system rely on standard input.",
