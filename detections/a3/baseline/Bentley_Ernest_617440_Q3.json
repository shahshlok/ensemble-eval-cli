          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, if a reference is non-null and you call an instance method like toUpperCase() or replace(...) on it, the method will either return a valid (non-null) String or throw an exception; it will not silently return null. Likewise, Scanner.nextLine() will not return null in normal use\u2014it will either return a line or throw an exception/indicate EOF through hasNextLine(). The student is treating null as a sort of default or failure value that any method might arbitrarily produce, rather than understanding that null only appears if it is explicitly assigned or returned according to the API\u2019s contract.
