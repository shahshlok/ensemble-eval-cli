          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, a `for` loop's structure includes three parts: initialization, condition, and update. When the statement `i = N;` is executed (line 45), the code proceeds to the end of the loop body. The next step is the loop increment expression (`i++` in line 42). This increment changes `i` from `N` to `N + 1`. After the increment, the loop condition (`i < N`) is evaluated. Since `N + 1` is not less than `N` (assuming `N > 0`), the loop terminates. While this approach effectively terminates the loop, it is overly complicated and prone to off-by-one errors in complex updates, demonstrating a lack of understanding or preference for the proper `break` statement, which is the idiomatic and most direct way to exit a loop prematurely.",
          "error_manifestation": "Wrong output or inefficient code (does not use `break`). In this specific case, the code *works* because `i` is set to `N`, then incremented to `N+1`, and the loop condition fails. However, it relies on the specific nature of `i++` and is a non-standard way to halt iteration.",

Simply assigning a value to the loop variable `i` does not prevent the loop from continuing\u2014the assignment happens, but the for loop's increment expression (`i++`) still executes, and the loop condition is checked again. Setting `i = N` causes `i` to become `N`, then `i++` makes it `N+1`, which fails the condition `i < N`, thus exiting the loop. While this works by accident, it reveals a misconception about loop control flow.",
