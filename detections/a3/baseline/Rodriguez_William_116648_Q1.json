          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that using intermediate variables (a, b, c) to represent loop bounds and the result is necessary or clearer than direct values. They think assigning N to b and 0 to a before the loop makes the code more modular or easier to understand.",
          "conceptual_gap": "While this isn't technically incorrect, it reveals a misconception about when abstraction is appropriate. The student doesn't recognize that introducing unnecessary variables obscures intent rather than clarifying it. In Java, direct use of loop bounds (0 to N) is the standard idiom for array iteration. The student's mental model conflates 'using variables' with 'writing clear code', when in fact excessive indirection can indicate a lack of understanding of idiomatic Java patterns.",
          "error_manifestation": "Code works correctly but is unnecessarily complex. This suggests the student doesn't understand common Java conventions and may struggle to read/write standard code patterns.",

This suggests a slightly overly complex mental model for variable management in standard algorithms.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student correctly implements the linear search logic (using a break statement ensures finding the first occurrence). The use of extra variables `a`, `b`, and `c` is not conceptually flawed regarding program execution, but it demonstrates unnecessary indirection. `a` and `b` functionally duplicate `0` and `N`, and `c` could have been initialized and then reused as the loop variable `i` when the break condition is met, but initializing it to -1 and ensuring the loop breaks is a perfectly valid and common way to solve this problem.",
