          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that printing the required output ('index' or '-1') requires duplicating the exact format of the sample run, including the prefix 'Found at index: ' only if the element is found, and printing just '-1' otherwise, without a prefix.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The conceptual gap is not in the search logic (which is correct for finding the first occurrence) but in fully adhering to the prompt's output requirements, specifically when the target is not found. The prompt asks to \"Print the index... If T is not found, print -1\". The sample run shows 'Found at index: 1'. The student correctly imitates the 'found' case but incorrectly handles the 'not found' case by printing only '-1' instead of potentially matching the sample run's implicit expectation for output formatting, if such an expectation exists (though the prompt text suggests just printing the number ' -1' without context is sufficient). However, given the student's explicit handling of the '-1' case separately, there's a slight misalignment with the goal of producing *only* the result in the 'not found' case.",
          "error_manifestation": "Incorrect output format in the case where the target is not found. The prompt states to 'print -1' if not found. The sample run shows 'Found at index: 1' when found. The student's code prints '-1' without a prefix when not found, and 'Found at index: [index]' when found. While the 'not found' behavior is mostly correct based on the prompt text (\"print -1\"), the implementation is structured around checking `if(y==-1)` to handle the two distinct output formats separately, which is a correct programmatic way to satisfy the visible output requirement (index found vs. not found).",
