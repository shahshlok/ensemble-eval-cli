          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, arrays of length `n` have valid indices from `0` to `n - 1`. The loop `while (printIndex < arraySize)` already guarantees that `printIndex` will only ever take values in this range. Therefore, the inner condition `if (printIndex < arraySize)` is always true for every iteration of the loop, including when `printIndex` is pointing at the last element (`arraySize - 1`). To avoid a trailing space, the student should compare against `arraySize - 1` (i.e., `if (printIndex < arraySize - 1)`), or structure the printing differently. The misconception is an off-by-one misunderstanding of how `length` relates to the last accessible index.",
