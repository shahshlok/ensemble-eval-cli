          "conceptual_gap": "The operational model of assignment in Java dictates that the right-hand side (`arr[i - 1]`) is fully evaluated before the assignment to the left-hand side (`arr[i]`). Since the array elements are being shifted backwards (from n-1 down to 1), there is no risk of overwriting a required source value. The temporary variable is entirely redundant, demonstrating an over-generalization of the 'swap' safety principle (where a temporary variable is required) to a 'shift' operation (where it is not).",

This indicates a lack of trust in or understanding of direct variable assignment operations.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java (and most imperative languages), when assigning `A = B`, the value of B is read immediately and copied to A. The intermediate use of a temporary variable `temp = arr[i-1]; arr[i] = temp;` is unnecessary and equivalent to the simpler `arr[i] = arr[i-1];`. The student is introducing complexity and distraction by using a temporary variable where none is needed for preservation of state within the loop iteration.",
