          "conceptual_gap": "The student uses variables 'b' and 'c' to define the start and end of the loop, respectively, instead of using standard index arithmetic within the loop condition or initialization. While `b = N-2` correctly targets the second-to-last element, and the loop is structured to shift elements right, the use of `b` and `c` introduces unnecessary variables and slightly obfuscates the standard array iteration logic (from N-2 down to 0). Although the shift loop is technically correct for a standard array, it demonstrates a preference for pre-calculating simple index boundaries into separate variables, which is a common strategy when students are unsure about index ranges, potentially leading to off-by-one errors if the pre-calculation is wrong. In this specific case, the loop `for (int i = b; i >= c; i--)` (i.e., `for (int i = N-2; i >= 0; i--)`) correctly shifts elements starting from arr[N-2] up to arr[1], overwriting arr[N-1] down to arr[1].",
