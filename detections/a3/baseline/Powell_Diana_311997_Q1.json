The student treats the assignment of the index as a special case that requires confirmation it's the 'first' index found, rather than relying solely on the loop termination/break mechanism to guarantee the 'first' index.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In the student's implementation, the `break` statement (line 48) ensures that as soon as the condition `currentArrayValue == targetValue` (line 45) is met, the loop terminates. Because the loop iterates from index 0 upwards, the index stored in `searchIndex` at the moment of the `break` is guaranteed to be the index of the *first* occurrence. The internal check `if (firstOccurrenceIndex == -1)` (lines 46-48) is completely redundant and unnecessary because the `break` prevents any second occurrence from being processed.",
