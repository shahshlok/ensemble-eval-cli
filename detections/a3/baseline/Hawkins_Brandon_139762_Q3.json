          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that the String variables are being modified in place, or is confused about how sequential string transformations relate to the variable references. While the current code is logically correct (it converts to uppercase and then replaces spaces), the student's process shows they correctly managed intermediate results, demonstrating knowledge of how to *use* the methods. However, the 'Note' about immutability suggests a potential area of confusion, which the student sidestepped by correctly assigning the results of `toUpperCase()` and `replace()`. The code itself does not contain a bug related to string immutability in its execution, but if the student had attempted `userInputLine = userInputLine.toUpperCase().replace(' ', '_');`, it would still be correct. The existing structure simply introduces temporary variables.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The conceptual gap regarding immutability is masked by the correct use of assignment operations. The core Java model states that `String` methods like `toUpperCase()` and `replace()` return *new* `String` objects, rather than modifying the original object referenced by the variable. The student's code correctly captures these new objects (`upperCaseText` and `modifiedText`). No functional bug is present.",
