          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that the problem requires two different output formats: 'Found at index: X' when the target is present, and '-1' when the target is absent. This belief stems from analyzing the sample run's output ('Found at index: 1') and interpreting the requirement 'If T is not found, print -1' as two separate, distinct conditions for printing.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The conceptual gap is the failure to realize that the problem statement implies an output hierarchy or a single required output strategy. The requirement is simple: print the index (or -1 if not found). The sample run output 'Found at index: 1' is simply one possible presentation when found, but the problem only mandates printing the *index* (or -1). The student's code incorrectly enforces an `if/else` structure (lines 53-60) that prints the index only if it is not -1, prepended by 'Found at index: ', which is non-compliant if the problem intends for only the index number itself to be printed, even when found. In most programming contest scenarios, if the output value is the index, the surrounding text is extraneous and potentially incorrect unless explicitly requested.",
