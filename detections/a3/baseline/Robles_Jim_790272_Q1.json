          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that printing '-1' in the early check for negative size (lines 14-17) is sufficient to cover all edge cases related to impossible searches, neglecting the case where the array size is zero.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student's mental model fails to fully account for the implication of an array size of 0. While the code correctly initializes an empty array and the search loop correctly handles `arraySize = 0` (the loop condition `searchIndex < arraySize` immediately fails), the final output logic (lines 53-57) is designed outside this specific search path. The specific error is that the check for a negative size (lines 14-17) preempts the standard program flow, but a zero size must still proceed through input collection to reach the search logic, which then requires the final output handling to print '-1' regardless of the auxiliary size check. However, the final output logic correctly handles the 'not found' case (`firstOccurrenceIndex = -1`), which is the result when length is 0. The issue is primarily redundant logic for the negative check without considering zero as a distinct edge case needing explicit early handling if one were generalizing safety checks.",
          "error_manifestation": "Wrong output in the specific scenario where the input size is negative (e.g., input size -5), because the required output when not found must be followed by standard printing instructions if applicable. However, this is mostly a logic issue regarding control flow and input constraint handling, not a fundamental machine misconception. The code is logically correct for N>=0 inputs.",
