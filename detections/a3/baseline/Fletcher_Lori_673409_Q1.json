          "conceptual_gap": "The student has used the index variable correctly to store the result (-1 for not found, or the actual index). However, they failed to utilize the required output string for the success case consistently. The primary logical error is a misunderstanding of output format requirements, specifically separating the 'not found' case ('-1' only) from the 'found' case ('Found at index: ' + index). While the required output for not found is just '-1', the student prints it on a new line without any surrounding text, which is correct for the problem, but their implementation structure suggests they might also misunderstand that the required output '-1' must be printed *only* when `index == -1`. The key flaw is that if the target is not found, the requirement is to print '-1', but the student prints it surrounded by quotes, which is unnecessary and slightly confusing, though functionally correct here because no surrounding text is required.",
