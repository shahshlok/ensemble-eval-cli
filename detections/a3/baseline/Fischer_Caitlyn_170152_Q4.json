          "conceptual_gap": "While the requirement is to print the modified array with elements separated by spaces, checking if the current index is less than the last index (i < n-1) before printing a space is an overly complex and slightly brittle way to achieve this. A more idiomatic and simpler approach in Java is to print the entire array representation (e.g., using Arrays.toString(), or printing the last element separately) or to simply print the elements followed by a space, and deal with the trailing space if necessary, but the provided implementation is a common, though slightly verbose, way to satisfy the exact output requirement from many CS environments. The student successfully implemented the array right shift correctly. The printing mechanism, while verbose, is logically sound for meeting the sample output, so this is not a fundamental misconception about execution, but rather an observation on non-misconception related complexity.",

At this point, the last assignment performed was `x[1] = x[0]`. The element that should move into `x[0]` is already handled separately, but the shift logic needs to ensure it covers all necessary moves. In this specific shifting implementation, looping down to `i=1` is correct because position `x[0]` is handled by the stored value `a` (the wrap-around element). The issue is that the loop condition is correct for the intended shift: it shifts elements from `x[n-1]` down to `x[1]`. There is no actual conceptual gap in the shifting logic itself, but the output printing loop demonstrates a related error.",

The condition `i < n - 1` is correct for an array of size `n` because it ensures the space is printed only for indices 0 through `n-2`. This is a manifestation of confusion about array boundary logic when formatting output, where the student correctly identifies the need to stop spacing before the final iteration, but it is often tricky for beginners, showing a struggle with 0-based vs 1-based indexing applied to iteration counts.",
