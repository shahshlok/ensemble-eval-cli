          "description": "The submitted program solves a different problem (computing average acceleration from v0, v1, and t) instead of the assigned task (reading 5 integers and printing the sum of the even ones). As a result, none of the rubric requirements are met.\n\nRubric-based evaluation:\n- Reading 5 integers from input (0/1): The program reads 3 double values (v0, v1, t) instead of 5 integers, and the input prompt does not match the required behavior.\n- Loop structure to process inputs (0/1): There is no loop; the program does not iterate over 5 inputs.\n- Conditional check for even numbers (n % 2 == 0) (0/1): There is no conditional logic related to even/odd numbers.\n- Accumulating sum and printing result (0/1): The program computes acceleration and prints it instead of accumulating and printing the sum of even numbers.\n\nFeedback per category:\n- Reading 5 integers from input: Your code reads three decimal values for velocities and time, not five integers. For this question, you needed to prompt for and read exactly 5 integers (e.g., using nextInt in a loop).\n- Loop structure to process inputs: The program uses no loop, so it cannot process 5 separate inputs in a scalable way. You should use a for-loop that runs 5 times to read and process each integer.\n- Conditional check for even numbers: There is no check for even numbers. You needed an if-statement using n % 2 == 0 to decide whether to include each number in the sum.\n- Accumulating sum and printing result: Instead of computing (v1 - v0) / t, you should maintain an integer sum variable that starts at 0 and add each even number to it, then print \"Sum of even numbers: \" followed by the sum.\n\nOverall feedback: This submission appears to be for a different question (average acceleration) and does not address the required task of summing even numbers from 5 integers. Re-read the problem statement carefully and ensure that your input variables, control structures (loop and if), and output message all match the specified behavior.",
