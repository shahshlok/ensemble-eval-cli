          "conceptual_gap": "The student does not utilize simpler and more standard Java array printing techniques (like `Arrays.toString(array)`) or a simpler logic pattern inside a standard loop (like printing the elements, and then printing the separators *between* them, or printing the elements and then iterating back to overwrite the last space with a newline, or checking 'if not the first element, print space'). The current implementation correctly achieves the goal but suggests a misunderstanding/over-complication of basic structure needed for printing space-separated lists.",

          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that array rotation logic must be wrapped in a specific check (`if (N > 0)`) to prevent errors when the array size is zero, even though the preceding logic (`int[] arr_numbers = new int[N];`) already handles N=0 correctly (creating a 0-length array), and accessing `arr_numbers[N - 1]` when N=0 would be an `IndexOutOfBoundsException` only if the conditional protection was absent.",
          "conceptual_gap": "While the check `if (N > 0)` correctly prevents an `IndexOutOfBoundsException` on line 18 (`arr_numbers[N - 1]`) when N=0, the need for this explicit defensive coding suggests the student may not fully trust the upstream input handling or standard execution path, or they are anticipating an error that rarely occurs in typical array processing where the loop structure itself handles the N=0 case (though array index access like line 18 requires boundary protection). In this specific context, the check is necessary but overly defensive if the problem constraints imply N >= 1, or it suggests the student anticipates N=0 input, which is often a special case. Given the loop structure starting at N-1 (line 21), the check is strategically placed to avoid the exception, but classifying it as a misconception stems from the desire to handle N=0 outside of the standard array rotation logic.",
