          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that using the `break` statement inside the loop guarantees that the loop will terminate immediately upon finding the first match, and that the index variable, having been updated to the current index `i`, will hold the correct first-occurrence index without any further modification, thus fulfilling the requirement for finding the *first* occurrence.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student's code is logically correct. The use of `break` immediately terminates the loop (the search) upon the first successful conditional match (`arr[i] == t`). Since the loop iterates from index 0 upwards, the first match found must be the first occurrence. The variable `index` is initialized to -1 (the not-found default) and is only updated inside the loop when a match is found, just before the loop terminates. This correctly identifies the first occurrence's index or remains -1 if no element is found.",
