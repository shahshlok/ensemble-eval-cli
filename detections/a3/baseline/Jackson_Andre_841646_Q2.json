          "description": "Grading based on rubric (total 5 marks):\n\nScores per category:\n1. Generating random number (1-100): 0/1\n   - No use of Random, no secret number between 1 and 100 is generated.\n2. Loop for guessing (while/do-while): 0/1\n   - Program runs once, takes three numeric inputs for a cost calculation, no repeated guessing.\n3. Logic for \"Too high\" hint: 0/1\n   - No comparison between guess and secret number; no \"Too high\" message.\n4. Logic for \"Too low\" hint: 0/1\n   - No comparison between guess and secret number; no \"Too low\" message.\n5. Specific termination condition (correct guess): 0/1\n   - Program does not have a condition based on a correct guess; it always executes once and exits after printing cost.\n\nFeedback per category:\n1. Generating random number (1-100):\n   - Feedback: The program should start by picking a random integer between 1 and 100 using Random (e.g., int answer = rand.nextInt(100) + 1;). Your code instead reads driving data and computes a cost, so no random game state is set up.\n\n2. Loop for guessing (while/do-while):\n   - Feedback: The number guessing game requires a loop that keeps prompting the user until they guess correctly. Here, the program just takes three inputs (distance, mpg, price) and then finishes, so there is no guessing loop.\n\n3. Logic for \"Too high\" hint:\n   - Feedback: Each incorrect guess should be compared to the secret number and should trigger a \"Too high!\" message if the guess is larger. There is no such comparison or message in this solution.\n\n4. Logic for \"Too low\" hint:\n   - Feedback: Similarly, guesses lower than the secret number should produce a \"Too low!\" message. The program does not implement any branching based on a guessed value.\n\n5. Specific termination condition (correct guess):\n   - Feedback: The loop should terminate only when the user guesses the secret number, and then report the number of guesses taken. This code always terminates after doing one cost calculation and does not track guesses or correctness.\n\nOverall feedback:\n- The submitted program solves a different problem (road trip cost calculator) instead of the required number guessing game. To receive marks, you need to:\n  - Generate a random integer between 1 and 100.\n  - Use a loop that repeatedly asks the user to guess.\n  - Compare each guess with the secret number and print \"Too high\" or \"Too low\" as hints.\n  - Stop the loop only when the guess equals the secret number and then report how many guesses were taken.\n- Before coding, re-read the problem statement carefully and outline the required inputs, processing (randomness, loop, comparisons), and outputs (hints and final success message).",
