          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that when performing an in-place array shift, introducing a temporary variable inside the loop to hold the element being shifted (`int holder = arr[i - 1];`) is sufficient to prevent overwriting necessary data before it is used. They fail to recognize that the critical datum, the value being shifted into the current index `arr[i]`, is already the data located at `arr[i-1]`, and saving this `arr[i-1]` value in a temporary variable (`holder`) before assigning it to `arr[i]` serves no protective purpose, leading to a direct chain of overwrites.",
          "conceptual_gap": "When shifting elements in an array, the iteration direction must assure that the destination index (`arr[i]`) is updated only after the value currently residing there has been copied to its *next* required location (`arr[i+1]`). For a right shift (where `arr[i]` moves to `arr[i+1]`), the loop must proceed backward (from `N-1` down to `1`). The student correctly iterates backward. However, within the loop, the student introduces an unnecessary temporary variable (`holder = arr[i - 1];`) and then assigns this value to `arr[i]`. This structure, while not inherently wrong, obscures the fact that the assignment `arr[i] = arr[i - 1];` is the correct operation when iterating backward. More importantly, the use of `holder` does not fix the fundamental logic issue present in the original (before the fix) conceptual error: if the student had been iterating forward, a single temporary register inside the loop would fail because it only holds the value of the immediate prior cell, which itself might have already been overwritten in a previous iteration. Since the student performed the correct iteration logic (backward shift) but used confusing variable names (`holder`), the confusion lies in understanding which values must be maintained across iterations, though the current implementation works because the backward shift inherently uses the correct source element.",
          "error_manifestation": "Incorrect output, where shifted elements are duplicated. The output becomes '4 1 1 1' instead of '4 1 2 3' if the input was '1 2 3 4'. This is because the shift loop (lines 35-37) repeatedly copies the value of `arr[i-1]` into `arr[i]`, causing a cascade of copies of the first element's previous value.",
