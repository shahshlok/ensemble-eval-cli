          "conceptual_gap": "The student has a correct implementation for the logic (finding the first index or default to -1), but they fail to output the correct string when the target is not found. The requirement states: \"Print the index of the first occurrence of T in the array. If T is not found, print -1.\" The sample output shows 'Found at index: 1'. When not found, the output should just be '-1' without any prefix. The student correctly handles the found case (line 12) but incorrectly handles the not-found case (line 11) by only printing '-1' without any explanatory text, failing to match the expected format for the index output when found.",
          "error_manifestation": "Wrong output formatting when the target is not found. The problem states to print the index if found, or -1 if not found. The sample output provides an example for when it is found: 'Found at index: 1'. The student's code correctly outputs 'Found at index: Z' when found, but when not found, the student's code outputs only '-1' (line 11), while the sample text for the failure case often implies a different presentation in a testing environment (e.g., just the number, not the surrounding prompt text). However, given the structure of the successful output, the failure means the explicit print of '-1' on line 11 might not align with how a non-found scenario is expected to be displayed if the problem implies always using 'Found at index:' or requires a different format entirely. Since the successful case uses a prefix and the printing of '-1' does not, there is a formatting inconsistency.",
