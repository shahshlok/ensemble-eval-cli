This suggests a redundant safety check, perhaps due to not fully trusting the immediate termination provided by `break` or confusion about the initialization and single assignment nature of the variable.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The purpose of the current search loop is solely to find the *first* occurrence. By initializing `firstOccurrenceIndex` to -1 and using `break` immediately upon finding a match, the `if (firstOccurrenceIndex == -1)` check inside the discovery block is entirely redundant. Since the loop *only* continues if no match was found (or if it hasn't broken yet), the first time a match is found, `firstOccurrenceIndex` is guaranteed to be `-1`.",

Because the loop starts from index 0 and proceeds sequentially, the first time the condition `currentArrayValue == targetValue` (Line 40) evaluates to true, the associated index is guaranteed to be the first occurrence. The nested check `if (firstOccurrenceIndex == -1)` (Line 43) is therefore logically redundant and unnecessary for correctness.",
