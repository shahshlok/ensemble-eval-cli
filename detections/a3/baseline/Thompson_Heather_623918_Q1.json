Furthermore, the student assigns the loop index `i` to a separate variable `a` (`a = i;`) before use, suggesting a belief in necessary variable indirection or confusion over how to access the current index for array lookup.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The execution model demonstrates that the loop index `i` is the definitive and necessary variable for sequential access (`arr[i]`). The variables `a` and `b` are redundant. `b` is completely unused, and `a` only holds the value of `i` for one line before being assigned the current `i` again, indicating that the student does not fully internalize the direct role and utility of the loop control variable.",
