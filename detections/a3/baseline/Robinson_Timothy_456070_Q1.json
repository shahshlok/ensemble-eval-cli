The mental model lacks understanding that user-facing output requires deliberate formatting decisions.",

          "conceptual_gap": "The problem specifies two possible outputs: the index (if found) or -1 (if not found). The student correctly handles the search logic but fails to map the output logic directly to the problem requirements for all cases. Specifically, when the target is not found, the requirement is to print *only* `-1`. The student correctly prints `-1` for the failure case but prints a custom string for the success case (`\"Found at index: \" + found_index`). Although the index is present, the presence of the descriptive string violates the implicit requirement of printing only the index for success cases based on the sample output, or explicitly required in the failure case.",
          "error_manifestation": "Wrong output format/content when the target is found. The sample output structure is violated (e.g., printing 'Found at index: 1' instead of just '1' if the sample is interpreted strictly, although the failure case handling also masks the required `-1` printing in the success path). However, the major functional error here is mixing required output (-1) with optional formatting text (success output).",
