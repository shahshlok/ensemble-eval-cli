          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that a boolean flag ('index == -1') or a sentinel value is sufficient to stop the search *after* finding the first occurrence, but mistakenly requires this condition to be explicitly true *before* entering the loop body for subsequent checks, leading to a redundant check inside the loop.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The loop condition `i < n && index == -1` correctly implements the 'stop on first find' requirement by ensuring the loop only continues when no match has been found (`index == -1`). However, the student's implementation of the check *inside* the loop is also correct and doesn't rely on a flawed mental model, but rather introduces unnecessary complexity and potential inefficiency. The use of `int a = arr[i]; int b = t;` is also slightly redundant but functional. The core logic is sound, but the student's explicit tracking of the search state via `index == -1` as a loop exit condition is a sophisticated, but potentially confusing approach for a simple search.",
          "error_manifestation": "The code produces correct output and correctly implements the 'Find the First Occurrence' requirement. The misconception here is minor and revolves around overly complex or slightly redundant logic for loop termination, rather than a functional bug.",

They believe that creating intermediate variables somehow makes the comparison more reliable or is a necessary step. In reality, comparing arr[i] == t directly is equally valid and more idiomatic.
