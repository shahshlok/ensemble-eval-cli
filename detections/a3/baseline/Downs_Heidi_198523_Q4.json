          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that when performing an assignment operation like 'arr[i] = arr[i - 1];', the value of the temporary variable 'temp' (which was previously assigned 'arr[i - 1]') must be used to perform the assignment, even though 'arr[i - 1]' is still available and hasn't been overwritten yet. They seem to introduce 'temp' to hold a value that is immediately used in the next line within the loop iteration, despite the fact that the assignment 'arr[i] = arr[i - 1]' achieves the same result more directly and without the redundancy.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student fails to understand the minimal necessary steps for an array shift using a single loop and a stored last element. When shifting elements from index $i-1$ to index $i$ in a backwards loop, the value at $i-1$ is not overwritten until the current index $i$ has been processed. Therefore, using an intermediate temporary variable ('temp') to store 'arr[i - 1]' right before that value is used in 'arr[i] = temp' is redundant; 'arr[i] = arr[i - 1];' is sufficient and cleaner. While the code is technically correct, it demonstrates an unnecessary complexity in simple assignment operations, possibly rooted in overgeneralizing the need for temporary variables (like when swapping two specific elements).",
