          "conceptual_gap": "There is no conceptual gap in the execution model or algorithm. The logic to find the first occurrence is sound (`for` loop with `break`). The error is strictly in adhering to the exact output format specified in the prompt for the 'not found' case. The student outputs 'Found at index: ' + index for successful finds, but outputs just '-1' for the not-found case, whereas the problem description implies a standard output format (though the sample run only shows a successful case). The critical observation is that the student's final logic block handles the index assignment correctly but has a minor deviation in handling the required output if not found. However, based on the sample output, the student's code *is* logically correct and meets the functional requirement of the sample run and general requirements, except for the explicit instruction in the problem prompt to 'Print the index... If T is not found, print -1.' The student's code adheres to this by printing just '-1' in the 'not found' case, and adding a descriptive prefix in the 'found' case, which seems to follow the sample run's style (though the sample doesn't show the not-found case). Given the code's robust logic for finding the *first* occurrence, no notional machine misconception is identified.",
