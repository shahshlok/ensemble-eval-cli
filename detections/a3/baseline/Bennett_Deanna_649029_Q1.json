          "conceptual_gap": "The purpose of the `firstIndex` variable is to store the final result (the index or -1). The logic for finding the index (or keeping -1) is correctly implemented within the loop (lines 20-24). The student fails to recognize that the final value stored in `firstIndex` *is* the answer, regardless of whether it's an index or -1. The conditional logic (checking if `firstIndex == -1`) is redundant for assigning the value, but necessary for matching the *output format* (although the student's output format is technically correct in this case, the decision structure suggests a misunderstanding of flow control's impact on the final variable state).",
