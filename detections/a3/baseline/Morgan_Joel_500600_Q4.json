They think the pattern `temp = numbers[i-1]; numbers[i] = temp;` is necessary to preserve the value before assignment.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student doesn't recognize that a direct assignment `numbers[i] = numbers[i-1]` accomplishes the shift without needing an intermediate temporary variable. The temporary variable pattern is typically used for swapping two values, not for shifting. In this shifting context, the student conflates the swap pattern with the shift pattern, leading to redundant code that still produces correct output but indicates a misunderstanding of when temporaries are actually needed.",

This suggests a misunderstanding of direct variable assignment in simple array element copying, where `numbers[i] = numbers[i-1]` is equivalent and more direct.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student introduces an unnecessary temporary variable (`temp`) to facilitate the assignment within the loop body. In Java (or most imperative languages), the operation `numbers[B] = numbers[A]` copies the value of `numbers[A]` directly to `numbers[B]`. The use of `temp` here is redundant, as it only holds the value of `numbers[i-1]` for one instantaneous assignment step. While harmless in this context, it reflects an overly cautious or verbose approach to simple variable assignment that might stem from previous misconceptions related to swapping or needing backup copies.",
