          "conceptual_gap": "The student has correctly implemented the requirement of maintaining parallel arrays by swapping elements in both the 'scores' and 'names' arrays simultaneously during the Bubble Sort algorithm. However, the problem only requires finding the highest score and its corresponding name *after* sorting the scores (ascendingly). The student correctly identifies that in an ascendingly sorted array, the maximum element is at the end (index 'n-1'). The gap is not in the sorting logic itself, but in fulfilling the parallel array requirement correctly, which the student has done. The only potential conceptual gap is if the student misunderstands that sorting is necessary *only* to find the highest score, when a simpler maximum-finding loop would suffice, but even then, the sort logic is sound and achieves the goal.",

While implementing the optimization `n - 1 - i` in the inner loop, they might conceptually confuse arrays of size `N` with indices running from `0` to `N - 1`, leading to reliance on the `-1` safety net in the outer loop (`i < n - 1`) and the inner loop's boundary calculation, suggesting they are indexing cautiously rather than fully understanding the exact number of passes/comparisons required.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The code implements a functionally correct, optimized Bubble Sort. However, the consistent use of boundaries derived from `N - 1` often indicates a student's lack of confidence in translating 'N elements' into precise `0` to `N - 1` indexing, fearing `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` if they were to use `>=` or incorrect loop limits. For example, if array size is 1 (`n=1`), the outer loop runs `i < 0`, the sort is skipped entirely, which is correct, but reflects a pattern of defensive boundary setting without deep understanding of the indices.",
