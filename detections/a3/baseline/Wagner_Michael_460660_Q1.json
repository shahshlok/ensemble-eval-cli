The program reads three double values (v0, v1, t), computes acceleration, and prints it, rather than reading 5 integers, checking which are even, accumulating their sum, and printing that sum. This reflects a misunderstanding or misreading of the assignment requirements rather than a small coding slip.\n\nRubric-based scoring and feedback:\n- Reading 5 integers from input (1.0 pt): 0/1\n  Feedback: The program reads 3 values (v0, v1, t) as doubles instead of 5 integers. It also prompts for 'v0, v1, and t' instead of '5 integers'.\n\n- Loop structure to process inputs (1.0 pt): 0/1\n  Feedback: There is no loop at all. The task requires processing 5 inputs, typically using a loop to read and handle each value.\n\n- Conditional check for even numbers (n % 2 == 0) (1.0 pt): 0/1\n  Feedback: No conditional logic checks for even numbers; the code performs a numerical formula for acceleration instead.\n\n- Accumulating sum and printing result (1.0 pt): 0/1\n  Feedback: The program computes a single acceleration value with a physics formula and prints it. It never computes or prints the sum of even numbers.\n\nOverall feedback: Score = 0/4. The submitted program solves a different problem (average acceleration) and does not address the requirements of summing even numbers from 5 integers.
