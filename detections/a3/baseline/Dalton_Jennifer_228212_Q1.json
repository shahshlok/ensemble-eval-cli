          "conceptual_gap": "The student confuses C-style loop control with Java's standard control flow mechanisms. While setting `i = N` within the loop body will cause the loop termination condition (`i < N`) to fail on the *next* check, Java provides the `break` keyword for immediate loop exit. Furthermore, this technique is brittle and error-prone compared to using `break` or a `while` loop with a flag. In this specific case, because `i` is set to `N`, the post-iteration increment (`i++`) will make `i` equal to `N + 1`, successfully stopping the loop, but it demonstrates a misunderstanding of the idiomatic and clearer way to exit a loop early.",

          "conceptual_gap": "The student has a flawed understanding of how for-loop iteration works. In a for loop `for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)`, the loop condition is checked at the beginning of each iteration. While setting `i = N` will cause the condition to fail on the next iteration, this is an unreliable and indirect way to exit. The student should use a `break` statement instead. More importantly, the student may not fully understand that the increment `i++` happens after each iteration, so setting `i = N` and then having `i++` execute means `i` becomes `N + 1`, which works but is unnecessarily confusing. The core misconception is treating manual variable manipulation as equivalent to proper loop control flow.",

          "conceptual_gap": "In Java `for` loops, the assignment `i = N;` inside the loop body does not immediately break the loop. After the body executes, the loop's increment statement (`i++`) runs, changing `i` to `N + 1`. Critically, the loop condition (`i < N`) is then checked. While this setup eventually causes termination (since `N + 1` is not less than `N`), the conventional and idiomatic way to achieve early termination is using the `break` keyword. Assigning the boundary value is an indirect and potentially fragile method of breaking, but in this specific case, it works primarily because the loop structure relies on the condition `i < N` failing on the *next* check, achieving the desired 'first occurrence' logic, but reflecting a misunderstanding of direct loop control flow.",
