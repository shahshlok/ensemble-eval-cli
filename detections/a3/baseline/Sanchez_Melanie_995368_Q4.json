          "conceptual_gap": "The student has correctly implemented the array shifting logic but has a minor error in output formatting. Specifically, they are printing all elements and then attempting to print a space *only* if the current index is not the last one. However, when printing the array elements, they are printing `arr_numbers[i]` and then potentially a space. Their current logic: `System.out.print(arr_numbers[i]);` followed by `if (i < N - 1) { System.out.print(\" \"); }` is correct for printing a space-separated list. However, reviewing the provided code execution, the only potential issue is the lack of a space *after* the shifted colon for the visual match of the sample output, or perhaps a misunderstanding of how `System.out.print` accumulates output.",
          "error_manifestation": "Incorrect output format (minor, although the logic for iteration and shifting is correct). The student code produces 'Shifted: 4 1 2 3' which perfectly matches the sample output 'Shifted: 4 1 2 3'. Thus, there is no conceptual gap related to the *shifting* or the *printing* logic being incorrect. The array shifting code is correct.",
