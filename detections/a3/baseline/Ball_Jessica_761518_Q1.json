However, the student believes that the variable `index`, initialized to -1, will automatically retain the *only* value assigned upon finding the target, guaranteeing it's the first occurrence's index, while overlooking the requirement to handle the 'not found' case cleanly alongside the found case via the loop control structure.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student correctly uses `index = -1` for initialization and `index = i` followed by `break` upon finding the element. This correctly models finding the *first* element because the loop iterates sequentially and `break` ensures termination. The structure is conceptually sound and produces the correct result for this specific problem (finding the first occurrence) when an element is found or not found, as `index` remains -1 if the loop completes without a `break`. There is no logical error or conceptual gap leading to incorrect results in this particular implementation, as the initialization to -1 handles the failure case and the sequential iteration plus break guarantees the 'first occurrence' index for success.",
