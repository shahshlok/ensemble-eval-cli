          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that when iterating backward through an array to shift elements (e.g., `numbers[i] = numbers[i - 1]`), they need to use a temporary variable (`temp`) to store the value of the source index (`numbers[i - 1]`) before assigning it to the destination index (`numbers[i]`). They do not recognize that direct assignment is sufficient and that introducing an unnecessary temporary variable that is redefined in every iteration achieves nothing more than direct assignment, nor do they realize that the specific way they used `temp` (`numbers[i] = temp;` where `temp = numbers[i - 1];`) is functionally equivalent to `numbers[i] = numbers[i - 1];` but unnecessarily complex.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student has a flawed understanding of the immediate effect of variable assignment and temporary variable usage within a loop during array manipulation. While storing the *wrapping* element (the last element) is necessary, storing intermediate elements from the source index (`numbers[i - 1]`) is redundant. The core operation `numbers[i] = numbers[i - 1]` achieves the shift directly by copying the value from the location one step to the left, and this copy operation does not require an intermediate `temp` variable. Furthermore, the way the student introduces the temporary variable suggests an over-reliance on `temp` variables even when simple direct assignment suffices, potentially derived from confusing the standard two-variable swap operation with the array shift operation.",
