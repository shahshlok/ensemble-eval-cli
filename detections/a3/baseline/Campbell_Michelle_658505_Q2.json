They fail to account for the fact that elements are correctly placed after each pass and subsequent passes should ignore these sorted elements.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In an optimized or standard bubble sort, the inner loop boundary must shrink (by subtracting the outer loop index) because the largest element of the current unsorted segment is guaranteed to be placed correctly at the end of the array slice after each complete pass. By keeping the inner loop boundary constant, the student's algorithmic model performs redundant comparisons and swaps on the already sorted tail of the array, demonstrating a lack of understanding of control flow dependency on algorithm state/progress.",

The problem assumes N >= 1 (at least one student exists). By setting numberOfStudents to 0 when it's negative, the student creates a scenario where the parallel arrays are empty, which is not part of the problem's contract. The check `if (numberOfStudents < 0)` treats negative input the same as zero, which masks the real issue: negative input is invalid and should either be rejected or cause an error, not silently converted to zero.",
          "error_manifestation": "While the code handles the zero case without crashing (due to the final `if (numberOfStudents > 0)` guard), this represents a logical misunderstanding.

The code does correctly maintain parallel array integrity during swaps. The real conceptual issue is that the student may not understand that more efficient sorting algorithms (or even an optimized bubble sort with early termination) exist, suggesting a gap in algorithm understanding rather than a Java execution model misunderstanding.",
