          "conceptual_gap": "In normal Java execution, `Scanner.nextLine()` guarantees a return of a non-null String reference (even an empty one). Since `userInputLine` is non-null, and standard String methods like `toUpperCase()` always return a non-null String, the variable `finalResultString` is guaranteed to be non-null. The explicit null check is therefore redundant and reflects a misconception about the guaranteed state of variables initialized from reliable library methods.",

This stems from an overly cautious interpretation of Java's String immutability, treating even minor steps as requiring unique storage that must not overwrite the previous variable until absolutely necessary for the next step.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student understands that String methods return new strings (immutability) but fails to grasp that method chaining or reusing the same variable name instantly is standard practice when sequential transformations are needed. Java allows direct assignment of the result of a method call to the existing variable name (e.g., `userInputLine = userInputLine.toUpperCase().replace(' ', '_');`) without losing intermediary states unnecessarily, as the original object is garbage collected if no longer referenced. The practice shown here, though functionally correct, suggests an unnecessary proliferation of variables which bloats the cognitive model of memory management.",

This suggests a generalized, perhaps external or rule-based, belief that any object reference, regardless of context, always carries a significant risk of being null.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In this specific code path, `userInputLine` comes from `scanner.nextLine()`, which returns either a non-null String or throws an exception (never returns null). `toUpperCase()` and subsequent assignment also ensure the reference is non-null.
