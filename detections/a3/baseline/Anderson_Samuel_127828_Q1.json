Alternatively, the student might believe that the loop's structure is flawed for finding the first occurrence, even though the provided solution correctly uses 'break'. However, since the code *is* correct and successfully implements the `break` statement to exit the loop immediately upon finding the first match, this category is reported with low confidence, noting a complete absence of an actual bug, but validating the critical logic path.",
          "conceptual_gap": "There is no conceptual gap; the code is logically correct. The student correctly implemented the logic to find the *first* occurrence by initializing `index` to -1, iterating through the array, setting `index = i` when a match is found, and crucially, using `break` to terminate the loop immediately. This ensures that the index of the first match is preserved, and no subsequent matches, if any, will overwrite the result. The code correctly handles both the found and not-found cases.",

They correctly understand that the loop iterates from the starting index (0) upwards, but they don't seem to recognize that the initial value `index = -1` acts as the guarantee of 'not found' *only if* the loop completes without a match. If a match occurs, the loop correctly stops at the first instance, making the logic sound for this specific problem.",
