          "name": "Task Misunderstanding - Reading Wrong Problem",
          "description": "The student appears to have solved a completely different problem. Instead of writing a program to print a right triangle pattern made of asterisks, they wrote a program to calculate the area of a triangle given three coordinate points using the distance formula and Heron's formula.",
          "severity": "critical",
          "category": "conceptual",
          "student_belief": "The student believes the task is to: (1) read three coordinate points representing vertices of a triangle, (2) calculate the distances (sides) between these points, and (3) compute the area using Heron's formula.",
          "correct_understanding": "The task requires: (1) reading a single integer N representing the triangle height, (2) using nested loops to print N rows, and (3) printing i asterisks on row i, resulting in a right triangle pattern made of asterisks.",
          "symptoms": [
            "Program prompts for three points instead of a height",
            "Mathematical calculations for triangle area instead of pattern printing",
            "No loop structure to generate rows",
            "No asterisk output whatsoever",
            "Program output is numeric (area) instead of a text pattern"
          ],
          "root_cause": "The student misread the problem statement or confused it with a different geometry/area calculation problem. The similar word 'triangle' in both contexts may have caused confusion.",
          "remediation_hint": "Re-read the problem carefully: 'Print a Right Triangle PATTERN'. The key is that you're printing a visual pattern of asterisks, not calculating geometric area. Use a nested loop where the outer loop controls rows (1 to N) and the inner loop prints asterisks.",
