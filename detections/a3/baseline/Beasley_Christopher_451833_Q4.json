          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that printing the array elements and separating them by spaces is done by printing a space unconditionally after every element, except for the last one, which requires a conditional check. Additionally, the student formats the output string 'Shifted:' without a space after the colon, which doesn't perfectly match the sample output format ('Shifted: 4 1 2 3'), although this is often considered a minor formatting detail.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student performs the required array operation (the right shift) correctly. The conceptual gap lies in correctly replicating the precise output formatting structure used in the sample run, specifically the space handling when printing array contents. While the shifting logic itself is sound, the output generation sometimes reveals misunderstanding or oversight regarding expected spacing conventions within I/O tasks. (The student concatenates the elements with spaces correctly *between* elements, but the prompt's sample output usually implies a space after the leading label, which the student misses by using `System.out.print(\"Shifted: \");` instead of `System.out.print(\"Shifted: \");` which implicitly prints the leading space after the label). However, the primary logic is correct.",
