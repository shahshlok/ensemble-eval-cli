          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that a loop intended to shift values into every index starting from the last position must iterate down to index 0. They attempt to access `numberArray[arrayIndex - 1]` inside the loop, where `arrayIndex` is the destination index. When the loop condition `arrayIndex > 0` is reached, the body executes for `arrayIndex = 1` which accesses `numberArray[0]` for the source. They do not realize that the loop body should only cover indices from `arraySize - 1` down to `1`, as index 0 is handled separately.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The loop condition `arrayIndex > 0` correctly stops the loop right before `arrayIndex` becomes 0. However, the student's logic is actually correct for the shifting operation itself (arrayIndex = 1 is the last valid shift: numberArray[1] = numberArray[0]). The problem is that despite the correct logic, the resulting code only works if the initial approach to solving the problem is correct. In this case, the approach is fundamentally correct, and the loop boundaries are also correct for the shifting logic `numberArray[arrayIndex] = numberArray[arrayIndex - 1];`.",
          "error_manifestation": "No error, the code is logically correct and produces the expected output. The implementation of the reverse shift is standard and correct.",
