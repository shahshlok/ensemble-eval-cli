          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that using `if (c < 0)` (where `c = b - a`) will correctly sort scores in ascending order. They think that when the difference is negative, a swap is needed to move toward ascending order.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student has inverted the comparison logic. When `c = scores[j+1] - scores[j]` is negative, it means `scores[j] > scores[j+1]`, so a swap IS needed. However, the condition `if (c < 0)` triggers a swap precisely when this is true. While the swap itself is correct, the underlying mental model reveals confusion: the student computed `c = b - a` (later element minus earlier element) and then checked `if (c < 0)`, which actually works by accident for ascending order. The real issue is that this approach contradicts the stated problem requirement of sorting in ascending order while finding the highest score. For ascending order with the highest at the end (index N-1), this code is accidentally correct, but it suggests the student may not fully understand why the comparison works this way.",
          "error_manifestation": "The code actually produces correct output for the given sample input, but this is due to accidental correctness rather than clear understanding. The logic `c = b - a` followed by `if (c < 0)` does sort ascending, placing the maximum at the end, but the roundabout way of expressing this (via subtraction and negative check rather than direct comparison) suggests a misconception about comparison operators.",

          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, direct comparison of integers using `>` and `<` operators is the standard and clearest approach. Computing a difference and checking its sign is an indirect, error-prone method that conflates two separate concepts: computing a numerical difference and comparing values. This suggests the student may not be fully comfortable with relational operators and is instead trying to derive comparison results from arithmetic, which is a less intuitive mental model of how comparisons work in programming.",

Furthermore, the student incorrectly tries to use this pre-calculation to determine the swap condition.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student confuses the need for a simple comparison (`>`) with calculating the difference, potentially seeking an optimization or being confused about signed arithmetic in the context of sorting. While `b - a < 0` is mathematically equivalent to `b < a`, introducing intermediate variables `a`, `b`, and `c` serves no functional purpose in a standard comparison-based sort and suggests an unnecessarily complicated mental model for determining swap criteria.",
