          "conceptual_gap": "The student has correctly implemented the search and update of the index `z`. However, the required output format for printing '-1' when the target is not found is ' -1', not just '-1' on its own line/output stream, although the provided sample output only shows the success case. More importantly, the required output structure in the success case is 'Found at index: Z', which is correctly handled. The logic for conditional output is structurally sound (using `if(z==-1)` followed by an `else`), correctly handling the two required output paths.",
