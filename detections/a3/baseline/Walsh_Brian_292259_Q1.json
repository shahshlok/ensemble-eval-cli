          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that printing the literal string \"Found at index: -1\" when the target is not found is a special case that requires a separate `if` statement, distinct from the `else` block which handles the successful discovery. This seems to stem from a focus on matching the sample output format, specifically the `-1` requirement, without fully integrating it into the primary output structure.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student has correctly implemented the search logic (using `found_index = -1` as an initial sentinel value and updating it upon discovery, then breaking). However, in the final output stage, they treat the 'not found' case (`found_index == -1`) as needing a unique hardcoded output message (`\"Found at index: -1\"`). Although this produces the required output, it demonstrates a slight conceptual redundancy. The actual conceptual bug is subtle: the output message for the 'target not found' case is redundantly formatted. The prompt asks to print 'the index' (which is -1) OR '-1' if not found. The student's code prints \"Found at index: -1\". The logic is correct, but there is a minor redundancy in their implementation of the `if/else` block, where a simpler structure would suffice if they had merely printed the calculated `found_index` variable directly without the conditional logic, *except* for the difference in the required output string.",
