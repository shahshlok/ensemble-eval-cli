They failed to match the negative case formatting exactly to the positive case structure when using the provided sample output formatting, causing a slight divergence in the required output structure.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The assignment requires printing the resulting index (or -1) conditionally. The expected output format likely dictates that if found, the output is 'Found at index: X', but if not found, it should strictly print only '-1'. The student correctly structured the output flow but failed to notice that in the failure case (`y == -1`), the problem logic implies that they should only print the raw value `-1`, not the raw value `-1` followed by a custom message structure like the success case would require.",
