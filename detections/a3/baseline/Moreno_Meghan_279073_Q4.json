          "conceptual_gap": "The assignment statement `arr_numbers[i] = arr_numbers[i - 1];` is sufficient and standard practice for array shifting. The right-hand side (RHS) is evaluated before the assignment to the left-hand side (LHS) takes place. Introducing the explicit temporary variable `holder` between retrieving `arr_numbers[i - 1]` and assigning it to `arr_numbers[i]` is logically redundant and adds unnecessary complexity, indicating a misunderstanding of how sequential state updates work during simple array iterations.",

While the mechanism of storing `arr_numbers[i - 1]` in `holder` and then immediately assigning `holder` to `arr_numbers[i]` is functionally correct in this specific assignment step, the introduction of an unnecessary intermediary variable suggests a slightly rigid or misunderstood approach to sequential operations where direct memory manipulation is preferred or misunderstood.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student uses an unnecessary intermediary variable (`holder`) to hold a value read from `arr_numbers[i - 1]` before writing it to `arr_numbers[i]`. In Java, a direct assignment `arr_numbers[i] = arr_numbers[i - 1];` is equivalent, clearer, and more idiomatic. The presence of the temporary variable might indicate a prior struggle with data loss during updates, or a general conceptual misunderstanding of how direct assignment handles values in memory sequentially.",

          "conceptual_gap": "The conceptual gap is over-defensiveness regarding array access. The outer `if (N > 1)` ensures `N-1 >= 1` and `last_index >= 1`. If `N > 1`, then `last_index >= 1`, making the check `if (last_index >= 0)` always true and thus redundant.
