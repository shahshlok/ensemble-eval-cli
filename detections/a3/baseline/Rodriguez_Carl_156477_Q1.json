          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that printing the required output ('-1' or 'Found at index: X') only needs to consider the final state of the variable `a` after the loop finishes. They correctly use a sentinel value (`a = -1`) initialized before the loop and update it inside the loop. The logic for determining *what* to print is correct, but the output structure slightly deviates from the provided required output format when the target is found.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student successfully implemented the core logic (finding the first occurrence and using `break`) and correct conditional printing based on the result. There is no fundamental notional gap concerning variable lifespan, loops, or arrays. The only discrepancy is related to the exact output format instructions, which is a minor specification adherence issue, not a flaw in the mental model of computation. The required output for a found target is 'Found at index: 1', and the student prints 'Found at index: ' followed by the index, which matches the sample run exactly. Therefore, the implementation is logically sound and adheres to the visible requirements.",
