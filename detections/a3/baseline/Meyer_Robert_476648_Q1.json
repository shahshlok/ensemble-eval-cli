They may view mathematical manipulation (finding the difference `c` and checking if it's zero) as a more 'robust' or 'explicit' way to perform equality checks, despite the fact that direct equality is clearer and standard practice.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java (and most modern languages), the preferred and most idiomatic way to check integer equality is using the relational operator `==`. While checking if the difference is zero (`a - b == 0`) works mathematically for integers, introducing intermediate variables (`a`, `b`, `c`) and the subtraction step complicates the code unnecessarily without providing any conceptual or performance benefit. The student is creating a superfluous layer of mathematical abstraction for a basic logical comparison.",

The `==` operator directly compares two integers for equality, which is simpler, more readable, and more idiomatic than computing `a - b == 0`. This suggests the student may believe that arithmetic operations are a more 'fundamental' or 'mathematical' way to verify equality, or they may not fully understand that `==` is the standard tool for this task.
