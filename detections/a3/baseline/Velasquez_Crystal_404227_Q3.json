          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that the replace() method can accept a character literal (single quotes) as a search parameter and will automatically handle it in the context of string replacement, treating it the same way as a String would be treated.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student has confused two overloaded versions of the replace() method in Java. The String.replace(char, char) method is being called here, which replaces individual characters. However, the method signature expects char types, and while the code uses char literals ('_'), the first parameter ' ' (space as char) will only replace single space characters. The student may not fully understand that String.replace() has multiple overloads: replace(char, char) and replace(CharSequence, CharSequence). More critically, they may not realize that using char literals is actually correct for this particular overload, though the conceptual gap is in not recognizing this is the char-based replacement method rather than considering whether this is the right tool.",
          "error_manifestation": "The code actually produces correct output for the given sample input. However, the misconception lies in the student's apparent lack of deliberate choice between the two replace() overloads and potential misunderstanding of when to use char vs. String parameters.",

          "conceptual_gap": "The student doesn't understand that method chaining is possible and idiomatic in Java. Since Strings are immutable (as noted in the problem), each operation returns a new String object. The student could write `z = y.toUpperCase().replace(' ', '_');` directly, but instead creates multiple intermediate variables (y, n, z), suggesting they don't grasp that methods can be called on the return value of other methods.",

This suggests a rigid, sequential view of variable assignment where complex expressions or method chaining are avoided, perhaps due to viewing each step as an isolated unit rather than a flowing sequence of operations on a value.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The Java execution model allows for method chaining on immutable objects like Strings because methods return a new String object. The student unnecessarily declares and assigns two intermediate variables (`n` and `z`) when the entire transformation could be achieved in a single assignment or directly in the print statement, leveraging the return values of `toUpperCase()` and `replace()`.",
