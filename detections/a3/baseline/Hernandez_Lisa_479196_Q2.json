          "description": "The student wrote a \"RoadTripCost\" program that computes the cost of driving based on distance, MPG, and fuel price, instead of implementing the specified number guessing game where the computer picks a random number between 1 and 100 and the user repeatedly guesses with \"Too high\"/\"Too low\" hints until correct. As a result, none of the rubric requirements for Q2 are addressed.",

          "category": "conceptual",
          "student_belief": "I believe the task is to read driving distance, miles per gallon, and price per gallon from the user and compute the cost of a road trip.",
          "correct_understanding": "For Q2, you must implement a number guessing game: the computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, then repeatedly prompts the user to guess until they get it right, giving \"Too high\" or \"Too low\" feedback after each incorrect guess and reporting how many guesses were taken.",
          "symptoms": [
            "Program name and behavior focus on road trip cost instead of a guessing game.",
            "No use of Random or any random number generation.",
            "No loop structure that allows repeated guesses until correct.",
            "No conditional logic that prints \"Too high\" or \"Too low\" based on a guessed number.",
            "No termination condition based on a correct guess; program just performs arithmetic and exits."
          ],
          "root_cause": "Misinterpretation of the problem requirements or accidental submission of a solution for a different question.",
          "remediation_hint": "Re-read the Q2 prompt carefully and design the program behavior to match it exactly. Identify the required components: (1) generate a random secret number in [1,100], (2) use a loop to ask for guesses until the user is correct, (3) inside the loop, compare the guess to the secret and print \"Too high\" or \"Too low\" as appropriate, and (4) count the number of guesses and print it when the user guesses correctly.\n\nRubric-based evaluation for this submission:\n1. Generating random number (1-100) [1.0 point]\n   - Score: 0.0/1.0\n   - Feedback: No random number is generated; the program never uses Random or selects a secret number.\n\n2. Loop for guessing (while/do-while) [1.0 point]\n   - Score: 0.0/1.0\n   - Feedback: There is no loop that allows multiple guessing attempts. The program reads three inputs once and terminates.\n\n3. Logic for \"Too high\" hint [1.0 point]\n   - Score: 0.0/1.0\n   - Feedback: There is no comparison between a user guess and a secret number, and no \"Too high\" message.\n\n4. Logic for \"Too low\" hint [1.0 point]\n   - Score: 0.0/1.0\n   - Feedback: There is no comparison between a user guess and a secret number, and no \"Too low\" message.\n\n5. Specific termination condition (correct guess) [1.0 point]\n   - Score: 0.0/1.0\n   - Feedback: The program does not terminate based on a correct guess; it just finishes after computing and printing the cost.\n\nOverall feedback:\nYour submission correctly computes the cost of a road trip, but it does not implement the required number guessing game at all. For this question, you need to switch from the road-trip scenario to the game described: generate a random number, repeatedly prompt for guesses, provide \"Too high\"/\"Too low\" hints, and finish when the user guesses correctly while reporting the number of guesses. Start by writing pseudocode that directly mirrors the sample run given in the question, then translate that pseudocode into Java.",
