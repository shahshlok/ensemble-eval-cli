They implicitly assume that simultaneous write and read operations within the assignment statement might somehow fail or use a changed value unless the source value is buffered, showing anxiety about the atomicity or sequencing of data access.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student overcomplicates simple sequential assignment. In a right-to-left array shift, performing `y[j] = y[j-1]` is sufficient and safe because the source index (`j-1`) always points to an element whose value has not yet been overwritten during the current iteration sequence. Java evaluates the right-hand side (`y[j-1]`) completely before executing the assignment to the left-hand side (`y[j]`). The introduction of the temporary variable `h` is therefore redundant and reflects a flawed mental model regarding the necessity of buffering data when moving sequentially within a data structure.",

They treat the value of `y[j-1]` as transient and needing protection via a local variable (`h`) before being used to update `y[j]`, rather than simply using `y[j]=y[j-1]` directly.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The assignment operation `y[j] = y[j-1]` performs a direct copy of the value from the source index (`j-1`) to the destination index (`j`).
