          "conceptual_gap": "The student failed to realize that the array element at index 1 (`y[1]`) must receive the value from index 0 (`y[0]`). By setting the loop condition to `i > 0`, the loop terminates when `i=1` has been processed, but it misses updating `y[0]`, which is correctly placed *after* the loop (on line 14). The critical error is that the loop does not include the operation where `y[1]` is assigned `y[0]`. The range of indices being shifted is `y[n-1]` down to `y[1]`. For `y[1] = y[0]` to execute, `i` must be 1, and the loop condition must allow `i=1` to run. If `i` starts at `n-1` and stops at `i > 0`, then when `i=1`, `y[1]` gets `y[0]`, and the loop correctly stops before `i=0` (which is handled by the temporary variable `t`). The code exhibits correct standard shifting logic.",
