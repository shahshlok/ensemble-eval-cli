          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that array manipulation operations must always be explicitly guarded by checks like `if (n > 0)` to prevent runtime errors, even when sub-components of the logic (like the loop) are designed to handle iteration boundaries correctly. This suggests a general unease or over-generalization about array indexing safety, treating even non-empty arrays as potentially fragile near their boundaries.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The conceptual gap is subtle: While the `if (n > 0)` check is necessary to safely access `a[n-1]` when `n` is 0, the overall flow indicates a strong emphasis on halting execution entirely for boundary cases. Java's array indexing is strictly defined; the primary conceptual requirement is understanding the indices `0` through `n-1`. Over-relying on large conditional blocks for boundary safety can indicate a lack of robust trust in index arithmetic.",
