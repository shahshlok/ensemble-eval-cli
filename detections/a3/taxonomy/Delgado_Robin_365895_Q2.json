          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that by assigning the array values to local variables 'a' and 'b' (e.g., `int a = studentScores[innerLoopIndex]`), the subsequent comparison and decision logic (`if (a > b)`) is correctly based on those intermediate variables, and that using 'a' and 'b' somehow maintains a 'link' or 'shadow' relationship to the original array elements inside the swap block. However, within the swap block, they correctly access the array directly, suggesting a partial confusion about variable scope and necessity. The core belief is that 'a' and 'b' are necessary for comparison, but they fail to realize that 'a' and 'b' *must* be used consistently throughout the comparison and sorting logic if they are used at all, or, more simply, that 'a' and 'b' are entirely redundant and introduce potential confusion.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The variables `a` and `b` are declared and initialized as simple integer copies of the array elements before the `if` statement (lines 43-44). They hold the values at that single point in time. When the array elements `studentScores[innerLoopIndex]` and `studentScores[innerLoopIndex + 1]` are swapped later (lines 48-50), the values of the local variables `a` and `b` are not updated because Java variables do not automatically track or reference array cell content; they are primitive value copies.",
          "error_manifestation": "No functional error in this specific instance, as the student correctly references the array elements directly when performing the actual swap. However, the use of `a` and `b` is redundant and misleading, indicating a flawed model of how value copies work in comparison contexts.",

          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, array elements are accessed directly by index. Assigning `studentScores[innerLoopIndex]` to `a` and `studentScores[innerLoopIndex + 1]` to `b` creates local copies of the integer values. While this does not cause a functional error, it is overly complex and unnecessary, as the comparison `studentScores[innerLoopIndex] > studentScores[innerLoopIndex + 1]` achieves the exact same result without intermediate variable assignment. This suggests a misunderstanding of how variables and array indexing interact during simple comparisons.",
