          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, the assignment operation `numbers[i] = numbers[i - 1];` correctly copies the value from the right-hand side (R-value) to the left-hand side (L-value) in a single, safe step. Since the loop iterates backward, the shifting operation inherently preserves the correct source data. The explicit use of `temp` is redundant and adds unnecessary steps to the process, revealing a lack of understanding that array element copying is as straightforward as variable copying.",

          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that to shift elements to the right, they need to use a temporary variable to hold each element before moving it, similar to a manual swap operation. They think: 'I need to save numbers[i-1] in temp, then put temp into numbers[i]'.",
          "conceptual_gap": "While the temporary variable approach *could* work for a swap, the student has created an unnecessary intermediate step. The actual shift algorithm only needs to save the last element before the loop, then shift all elements right without needing temp for each iteration. The temp variable on line 16 doesn't actually preserve any value that would be lost\u2014numbers[i] is being overwritten, but the student is only copying numbers[i-1] into it, which will just be overwritten again in the next iteration. The logic accidentally works for a right shift, but the temp variable serves no purpose here.",
          "error_manifestation": "The code produces correct output for the sample input, but the temp variable (line 16) is conceptually redundant. This suggests the student misunderstands the shift operation and believes they need to protect intermediate values, when in fact a simple direct assignment (numbers[i] = numbers[i-1]) would suffice. This is more of a logical inefficiency than a functional error.",

They think the temp variable maintains persistent state across iterations or that declaring it fresh each iteration has special significance.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In reality, the temp variable is declared and immediately discarded each iteration. The student may not fully grasp that temp is local to each loop iteration (or if declared outside, it would be overwritten). The actual misconception here is subtle: the student thinks they *need* a temporary to perform a shift, when the algorithm simply requires: (1) save the last element outside the loop, (2) shift all elements right in-place, (3) place the saved element at position 0. The temp inside the loop is noise.",

Introducing `int temp = numbers[i - 1];` and then `numbers[i] = temp;` is redundant, though functionally correct in this specific pattern, it suggests they may be overcomplicating simple variable movement or misapplying the concept of using a temp variable (which is necessary only when swapping two variables, not when shifting one element).",
