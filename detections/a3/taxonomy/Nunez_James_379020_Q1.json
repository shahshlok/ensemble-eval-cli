          "conceptual_gap": "Java's execution model dictates that a `for` loop's continuation condition is checked before the first iteration. When `n=0`, the condition `i < n` (i.e., `0 < 0`) fails immediately, and the loop body is correctly skipped. The external `if (n != 0)` check is redundant and demonstrates a lack of full confidence in the loop construct's ability to handle the empty array edge case naturally.",

          "conceptual_gap": "While defensive programming is good, in Java, array sizes must be non-negative. If the user input were negative, the standard execution model would throw a runtime exception during array creation. The student attempts to preemptively handle this by forcing any negative input to zero, which prevents the exception but might not be necessary if input validation were guaranteed by the problem context or if the student was simply expected to let Java handle the exception. Furthermore, having a check for negative size after the input prompt might confuse the user who initially provided a negative size.",
