          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that using `break;` inside the loop guarantees that the resulting `index` variable will hold the index of the *first* occurrence of the target, even if the loop continues past the first match or if there is a fundamental issue with their understanding of conditional updating inside loops.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student correctly uses `break;` (L23) which halts iteration immediately upon finding a match. However, the subsequent output logic (L26-L29) fails to print *only* the index or -1 as required. Instead, the student introduces an unnecessary conditional block to handle the output, which hides a potential flaw if the `break` statement were missing or misplaced. While the `break` statement fixes the issue of finding the *last* index, the error in the output structure suggests a deeper confusion about how to handle the result of a conditional search (i.e., when to print the desired value versus the default 'not found' value) when the result might already be stored correctly.",
          "error_manifestation": "Wrong output formatting/excess output when `T` is not found, or potentially wrong index if `break` was omitted (though it is present here).",
