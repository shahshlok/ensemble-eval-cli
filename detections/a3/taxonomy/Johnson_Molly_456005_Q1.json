The execution model handles string concatenation as shown, but the student's *understanding* of what the output should be is incomplete or inaccurate when the target is not found. When the target is found, line 14 includes the text 'Found at index: '. When the target is not found, the student only prints the literal index value ' -1' (lines 13-14) instead of ensuring the output format is consistent, or perhaps they assume ' -1' is sufficient output when not found.",
