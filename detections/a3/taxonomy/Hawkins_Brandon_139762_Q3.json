          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that methods like toUpperCase() and replace() modify the String object they are called on in place, similar to how arrays might be modified in some languages, or how non-primitive objects are often conceptually modeled.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student's model contradicts the reality of String immutability in Java. In Java, methods like toUpperCase() and replace() do not change the String object; they return a *new* String object with the desired modifications. The student has correctly captured and repurposed these new Strings ('upperCaseText' and 'modifiedText'), so while they seem to understand the mechanical usage, the underlying mental model of Java String types is likely flawed because the prompt explicitly mentioned immutability, which they seem to have ignored or misinterpreted.",
