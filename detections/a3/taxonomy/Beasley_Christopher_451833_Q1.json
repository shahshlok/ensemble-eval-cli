          "conceptual_gap": "The assignment required printing the numerical index or -1 if not found. The student correctly prints the index prefixed by 'Found at index: ' when successful (as per sample), but when the target is not found, they fail to reproduce the literal numerical output of '-1' because they feel compelled to print a message instead of just the literal required value. The required output for 'not found' was just '-1', not a message.",
          "error_manifestation": "Wrong output format/contents when the target is not found (prints literal \"-1\" instead of just -1 or incorporating it into a sentence). Wait, the prompt says 'If T is not found, print -1.'. The student prints `System.out.println(\"-1\")`. This means they print the string literal \"-1\", which looks identical to the number -1 in the console, but the *intent* seems to be handling the 'not found' case as distinct based on whether a message is printed or not.",
