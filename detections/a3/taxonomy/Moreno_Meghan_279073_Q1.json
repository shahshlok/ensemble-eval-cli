However, if the search logic uses an `if/else` block, and the loop counter increment (`index = index + 1;`) is located in the `else` branch, the index counter will not be incremented in the subsequent iterations where the condition is false. But more critically, the next iteration's loop condition check (`while (index < temp_n)`) happens *after* the current successful iteration completes. Setting `index = temp_n` ensures the loop condition fails when checked again, which is a convoluted way of replicating a `break;` statement.
