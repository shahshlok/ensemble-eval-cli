          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that array indexing starts at 1, or confusingly uses a loop construct that runs one iteration too many (or too few) when traversing the array, resulting in inefficient or incorrect access patterns typical of confusing array size with the last valid index.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java and most programming languages, array indices are 0-based. Selection Sort requires the outer loop to iterate up to the second-to-last element, meaning the index should go up to `< numberOfStudents - 1`. If the loop runs up to `< numberOfStudents`, the algorithm is technically fine if the inner loop manages the bounds correctly, but selection sort is inefficiently structured here. More critically, the student uses `while (outerLoopIndex < numberOfStudents)` (Line 38). If `numberOfStudents` is 3, the indices are 0, 1, 2. The outer loop will run for 0, 1, 2. When `outerLoopIndex` is 2, the inner loop `innerLoopIndex = outerLoopIndex + 1` (Line 43) initializes to 3. The inner loop condition `while (innerLoopIndex < numberOfStudents)` (Line 44) immediately becomes false (3 < 3 is false). Running the outer loop when only one element remains (the last element) is redundant in Selection Sort, as that element is already in its final sorted position. This is an inefficiency rooted in a misunderstanding of selection sort's necessary bounds.",

This habit suggests a reluctance or inability to use the standard, structured iteration mechanism (`for` loop) expected in Java for definite array traversal, making the code harder to read and verify.",
