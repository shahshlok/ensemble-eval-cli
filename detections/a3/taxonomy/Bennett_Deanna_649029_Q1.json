They fail to recognize that since the sentinel value -1 is stored in `firstIndex`, the output logic can be consolidated into a single print statement using the variable, applicable to both success and failure cases.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student misuses the sentinel variable pattern. In the actual Java execution model, the variable `firstIndex` holds the comprehensive result (either a valid index or -1) and can be used directly in the final output concatenation. The student's model introduces unnecessary branching and code redundancy by treating the printing of the sentinel value as a special case, separate from printing a found index.",
