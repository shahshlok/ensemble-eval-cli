          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that array elements must be temporarily copied into named primitive variables (`currentScore`, `nextScore`) before they can be effectively compared in a conditional statement. This suggests a misunderstanding of how Java handles direct access to array indices for values (primitives), or a confusion between value-copying and necessity, implying that array access itself is insufficient for a simple comparison.",
          "conceptual_gap": "Java allows for direct comparison of array elements using their indices (e.g., `if (studentScoresArray[index] > studentScoresArray[index + 1])`). Declaring the intermediate variables `currentScore` and `nextScore` creates redundant, temporary copies of the array values solely for the purpose of the comparison condition. Since the student correctly uses the array indices for the subsequent swap, these auxiliary variables are unnecessary and add overhead within the inner loop.",

They assume that if a swap occurs later based on the comparison, it only affects the array, and the intermediate variables served only to 'read' the array state at that moment, without affecting subsequent array manipulation (the swap).",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, assigning an array element value to a primitive variable (like `int currentScore = studentScoresArray[index]`) is a pass-by-value operation that creates a copy. The variable `currentScore` loses all connection to the array structure. While mathematically redundant, declaring and using these intermediate variables is syntactically correct and harmless in this specific context because the swap logic correctly targets the array indices directly. The conceptual gap is not causing an error here, but demonstrates an overly complex mental model for accessing array data during comparison, perhaps confusing array access with referencing in other contexts.",

The student unnecessarily creates `currentScore` and `nextScore` variables, which are never used in the actual swap operation, potentially reflecting a belief that they are somehow necessary context or that array accesses are too complex for direct comparison.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, direct array comparison using `if (studentScoresArray[index] > studentScoresArray[index + 1])` is idiomatic and sufficient. The introduction of `currentScore` and `nextScore` serves no purpose but adds unnecessary complexity and variable tracking overhead, suggesting the student is using auxiliary variables as an unnecessary buffer between the array state and conditional logic, reflecting a weak grasp of direct array manipulation efficiency.",
