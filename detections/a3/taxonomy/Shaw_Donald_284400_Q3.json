The code shows correct understanding through assignment, but the structure suggests they may have needed to test or verify that `.toUpperCase()` and `.replace()` return new strings rather than modifying in place. The correct solution pattern (assigning return values) is present, indicating they overcame the initial misconception, but the evidence of struggle is in the code structure.",
