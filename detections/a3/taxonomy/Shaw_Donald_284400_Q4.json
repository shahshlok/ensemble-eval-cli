This suggests an unnecessary fear of using simple arithmetic expressions directly within the index brackets or a need to assign conceptual meaning (like 'last index' or 'source index') to a distinct variable.",

Expressions like `N - 1`, `0`, and `i - 1` are constant or simple operations that the execution model handles trivially and efficiently inline. Creating separate index variables for these single-use constants (`a`, `c`) or simple offsets (`b`) does not improve correctness but increases the reliance on explicit variable tracking, potentially hiding the true index calculation logic.",
