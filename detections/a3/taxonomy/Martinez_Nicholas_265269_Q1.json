Using variable assignment (`j = n`) to force termination works functionally but indicates a misunderstanding or lack of knowledge regarding Java's intended control flow features for iteration.",

          "conceptual_gap": "The student has correctly implemented the logic to exit the loop early when the target is found by setting j = n. However, the way it's done reveals a misconception about loop flow: the student may believe the assignment j = n directly causes loop termination, when in fact the while condition (j < n) is what actually evaluated on the next iteration. This works correctly in this case, but suggests the student views variable assignment as having immediate control-flow effects rather than understanding that loop conditions are evaluated at the top of each iteration.",

          "conceptual_gap": "While the code is functionally correct, it uses a less idiomatic approach (j = n to exit) instead of the standard Java mechanism (break statement). This suggests the student may not be fully aware of break's purpose in loops, or believes that explicit variable manipulation is the correct way to control loop flow. The conceptual gap is between understanding loop control flow constructs (break) versus manual counter manipulation.",

While setting the loop variable (`j`) to the exit condition (`n`) achieves the required functionality here, it obscures intent and is a brittle method compared to using `break`, especially in more complex loops (e.g., `for` loops where the increment step is separate).
