          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that array parallelism is maintained primarily by the conceptual index location (i) and might underestimate the necessity of explicitly and simultaneously mirroring every structural change (like a swap) across both arrays. While the student correctly implements the swap, this pattern often arises from a conceptual struggle with array autonomy.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, two arrays are entirely independent data structures. When an element is moved or swapped in one array (e.g., scores), the program must explicitly perform a corresponding move or swap in the parallel array (names) at the exact same indices. The Java Virtual Machine does not track the conceptual link between parallel arrays; this linkage must be managed manually using synchronous code execution.",
          "error_manifestation": "Data corruption would result (names would no longer match scores) if the synchronization were forgotten. In this case, the student coded the synchronization correctly, eliminating the error.",
