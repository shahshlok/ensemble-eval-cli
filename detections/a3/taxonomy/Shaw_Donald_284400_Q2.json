          "conceptual_gap": "The student has inverted the logic for bubble sort direction. When `a - b > 0` (meaning a > b), swapping moves the larger element forward in the array. To sort in ascending order, they should only swap when `a > b`, but this algorithm swaps when scores[j_index] > scores[j_index + 1], which is correct for ascending order. However, the student then finds the top student at index N-1 (the last position), which would be the maximum in ascending order. Actually, upon closer inspection, the sort logic IS correct for ascending order (larger elements bubble to the right), so the top student at N-1 IS correct. The real misconception is that the student may not have clearly reasoned through whether sorting ascending and taking the last element gives the maximum, suggesting they didn't think through the algorithm's correctness carefully.",
