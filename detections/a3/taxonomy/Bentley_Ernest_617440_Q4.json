          "conceptual_gap": "The student's mental model seems to assign an overly important logical role or structural necessity to temporary variables. In reality, modern execution models do not require creating a new local variable for every data movement step that can be done directly by array indexing, as seen in line 35, where the student unnecessarily introduces `temporaryPreviousElementHolder` instead of simply writing `userNumberArray[shiftingIndex] = userNumberArray[shiftingIndex - 1];`.",

This suggests a mental model preferring global (or larger scope) declaration for variables whose lifetime should ideally be restricted to the loop block.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, standard practice is to declare loop variables (like `int i = 0`) directly in the `for` initialization clause to limit their scope and prevent unintended side effects outside the loop. The student's model of local variables seems to prefer wider, pre-emptive definition, which is unnecessary and slightly less robust than block scoping.",
