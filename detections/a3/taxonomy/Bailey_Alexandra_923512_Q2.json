          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that a `Scanner` object wrapping `System.in` must be explicitly closed for proper resource cleanup, similar to standard files or network connections. This suggests a belief that the act of closing only affects the local `Scanner` object and is necessary to prevent resource leaks.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student fails to distinguish between locally created, non-global streams (which must be closed) and the standard input stream (`System.in`), which is a global resource managed by the operating system and the JVM. Calling `close()` on a Scanner attached to `System.in` closes the underlying stream, preventing any subsequent input reading in the JVM instance, which is generally considered incorrect practice for console applications.",

          "conceptual_gap": "The student misunderstands the side effects of `Scanner.close()`. In Java (especially when using `System.in`), closing the `Scanner` also closes the underlying stream (`System.in`). If output operations (`System.out.println`) are performed afterward, it doesn't directly cause an error in this specific setup, but it incorrectly models the interaction with the standard stream resources. Furthermore, closing `System.in` is generally discouraged in applications unless the application is explicitly terminating or switching resource management contexts, as it prevents other parts of the program or environment from using standard input later. The placement after the final output is structurally poor practice.",
          "error_manifestation": "Poor resource management (closing System.in), though it won't typically throw an exception based merely on placement after output, it reflects a misunderstanding of stream lifecycle.",
