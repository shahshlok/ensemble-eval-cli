This approach works only if every name is guaranteed to be a single token (i.e., contains no spaces).

The student seems to stop thinking after the sorting is complete, treating the final step of identification as a simple retrieval of the maximum item, rather than confirming that the sort resulted in the correct ordering/display for a leaderboard.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student correctly implements the mechanism (bubble sort) for sorting parallel arrays in ascending order. However, the conceptual requirement for a 'Leaderboard' usually implies displaying the result from highest to lowest. By sorting ascendingly, the student ensures the highest score is at `N-1`, satisfying the *highest score identification* requirement, but fails to use the sorted data to print a useful leaderboard (which typically means printing all results, or at least the top results, often displayed descendingly). This is more a misunderstanding of how the sorted data should be utilized after the sort, rather than an error in array manipulation itself.",
