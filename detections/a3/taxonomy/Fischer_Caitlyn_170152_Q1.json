          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that if the problem requires an output of N (e.g., 'Found at index: N') in one case, and a simple value (e.g., '-1') in another, they must use an 'if/else' structure to explicitly handle both formats, even if the index variable already holds the default '-1' value.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The core concept missed is the use of a simple, consistent print statement relying on the final value of the index container ('y'). Since 'y' is initialized to -1 (the failure condition) and updated to the correct index upon success, a single final print statement could be used, potentially simplifying the logic (e.g., printing the resulting index 'y' after the loop, and using the conditional structure only for the descriptive string 'Found at index: '). The student's implementation correctly uses `if/else`, but the redundant check for `y == -1` followed by a print of `\"-1\"` is a sign that they structure output based on required print strings rather than variable values.",
