They have correctly modeled the process of stopping the search after the first hit, preventing the index from being overwritten by subsequent occurrences.",
          "conceptual_gap": "There is no conceptual gap related to a flaw in the notional machine model relevant to this specific implementation detail. The student's approach, while slightly verbose (they could have just returned the index, or managed the initial state differently), correctly implements the required logic for finding the first index and printing -1 if not found. This demonstrates a strong functional mental model of iteration control flow (`break`) and variable state management.",
