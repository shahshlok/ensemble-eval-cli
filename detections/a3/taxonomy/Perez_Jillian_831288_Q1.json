          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that using `break` inside a loop guarantees that the search process stops immediately after finding the *first* match. They incorrectly expect the loop structure designed for iterating over all elements to inherently handle the 'first occurrence' requirement correctly even when the `break` is introduced.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student is unaware of the structural flaw in their loop's logic concerning the placement of the `index = -1` initialization relative to the termination condition. Although the `break` ensures the loop stops on the first match (e.g., index 1), the unconditional post-loop printing of the `index` variable, which only gets updated during successful matches, is combined with a flawed initialization logic designed for a standard sequential search, not a 'search and stop' requirement. However, in this specific implementation, the actual functional bug is subtle: when the `break` is used, the logic intended to find the *first* occurrence is actually fulfilled because once the `break` is hit, the loop terminates, and the index remains set to the correct first index.",
          "error_manifestation": "The code appears to meet the requirement for finding the first occurrence due to the use of `break` (as demonstrated by the sample output), but the initial definition of the variable `index = -1` (Line 17) suggests a standard pattern where the index is only updated if found. The misconception lies in understanding how initialization and termination interact. If the student had *not* used `break`, but only updated `index` on every match, they would have found the *last* occurrence. By using `break`, they correctly solve the requested problem, suggesting their mental model might be slightly functional but lacks robust awareness of initialization/termination boundary conditions.",
