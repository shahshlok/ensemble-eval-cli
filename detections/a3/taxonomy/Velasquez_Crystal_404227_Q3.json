          "conceptual_gap": "In synchronous, blocking console input scenarios presented in CS1 (like reading from System.in), hasNextLine() will block execution until input is available, making the subsequent nextLine() call redundant or unnecessary if the program logic assumes valid input is always provided by the user per the prompt. The common CS1 pattern is simply `String y = x.nextLine();` without the conditional check, unless special end-of-file handling is required.",
