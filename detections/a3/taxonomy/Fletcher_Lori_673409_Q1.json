The sample output for 'Found at index: 1' suggests a formatted string. However, when 'T' is not found, the student code handles this by explicitly printing ONLY '-1', which suggests they interpret 'Print -1' literally as the sole output in that case, leading to two separate `System.out.println` calls instead of generalizing the output based on the value of `index`.",
