          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that when moving data between two array indices in a loop (e.g., shifting), the source value (`arr[i-1]`) must be explicitly copied into a temporary, isolated variable (`a`) before the assignment takes place to ensure the value's stability and prevent any unintended side effects from simultaneous memory operations during array manipulation. They do not trust that the direct statement `arr[i] = arr[i-1];` will reliably fetch the source value before the assignment completes.",
          "conceptual_gap": "Java statements execute sequentially. For a basic assignment like array shifting, `arr[i] = arr[i-1];` is sufficient. The runtime environment evaluates the right-hand side (`arr[i-1]`) completely before executing the assignment to the left-hand side (`arr[i]`). Introducing the intermediate variable `a` is unnecessary overhead and indicates a lack of faith in the stability of sequential assignment semantics.",

The student seems to view the array indexes as delicate resources that need intermediate protection via a local variable, instead of recognizing that direct assignment between array cells is the standard and efficient mechanism.",
