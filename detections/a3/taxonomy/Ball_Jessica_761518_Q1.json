          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that by initializing the index variable to -1 and breaking the loop upon finding a match, they have completely fulfilled the requirement to find *only* the first occurrence. They fail to recognize that the `break` statement only stops computation, but doesn't logically ensure the stored index corresponds to the minimum index if the algorithm were run slightly differently.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The requirement is to find the index of the *first* occurrence. While the student's use of `break` (L24) correctly achieves this by halting the search immediately after the first match, the overall implementation implies a lack of foundational understanding of how array iteration (L20) naturally guarantees processing elements in index order during a linear search. They rely on the `break` for correctness, whereas any linear search starting from index 0 will inherently find the first occurrence first. This is less a functional bug and more a conceptual inefficiency or slight confusion about the fundamental nature of array iteration.",
          "error_manifestation": "Code is functionally correct for finding the first index due to the `break`, but the structure (initializing a variable before the loop and using `break`) might stem from a general template for finding 'an' element, without full integration of the 'first' requirement.",
