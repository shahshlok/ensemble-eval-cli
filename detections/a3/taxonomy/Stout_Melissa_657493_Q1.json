          "conceptual_gap": "Java expressions are evaluated immediately and reliably. Accessing `arr[i]` yields the value directly, making the introduction of an intermediate variable `a` unnecessary.

          "conceptual_gap": "The student's code correctly uses `break` (Line 24) immediately after finding the target, which is the mechanism required to stop searching and ensure the first index is captured. However, the logic used to print the result (Lines 28-32) is conceptually redundant with the requirement. The problem asks for the index of the first occurrence, or -1. The student implements the search correctly (stopping at the first hit) but then complicates the output by keeping the `index == -1` check, which, while correct for the scenario where *no* matches are found, feels like they might be missing the conceptual simplicity of returning the stored index or -1 *if* no match was found. Since the code is functionally correct for the requirement, this is a minor notional issue related to *efficiency* and *control flow intent*, rather than a flaw in output calculation.",
