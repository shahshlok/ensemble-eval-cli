Additionally, assigning one String variable to another (temp_holder = user_input; result = temp_holder;) just copies the reference, not a modifiable container; if the object were mutable, changes through one reference would be visible through the others, but for Strings the only way to get a changed value is to capture the new String that the method returns.
