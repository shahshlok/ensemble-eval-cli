The student implemented the swap correctly here, but this suggests potential confusion about why both swaps are necessary.",
          "conceptual_gap": "While the student's code actually does swap both arrays correctly, the mental model gap is that the student may not fully understand that parallel arrays require mirror operations on both arrays to maintain the pairing relationship. A student with a weak mental model might think 'I'll just sort the scores and the names will follow' without recognizing the necessity of synchronized swapping. The fact that the code works suggests the student may have copied/memorized the pattern rather than deeply understanding why both swaps are essential.",
