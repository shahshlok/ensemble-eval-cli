          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, loop control variables and temporary variables should be declared in the smallest possible scope (i.e., inside the `for` header or inside the loop body) to minimize variable lifetime and prevent scope pollution. Declaring `loopIndexI` (L31) and `currentArrayValue` (L32) outside the loop scope, and unnecessarily initializing `currentArrayValue` to 0 (which is immediately overwritten at L35), demonstrates a conceptual failure to map variable declaration to its specific need and lifetime.",

This suggests a confusion between necessary setup for calculation (which happens inside the loop structure) and redundant initialization.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, the variables `loopIndexI` and `currentArrayValue` are initialized just before the search loop (Lines 30-31), but this initialization serves no computational purpose for the logic inside the loop (Lines 34-43, where they are immediately overwritten). The student likely felt compelled to set initial values for these variables (`loopIndexI = 0`, `currentArrayValue = 0`) despite them being properly set by the loop construct (`for (loopIndexI = 0...`) and the assignment inside the loop body (`currentArrayValue = userInputArray[loopIndexI]`). This indicates a flawed mental model regarding the lifespan or required state management of temporary variables near loop boundaries.",
