          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that array indices start at 1 or, specifically in iteration, that accessing the element at index `i` implies that the previous element is at index `i-1` and that this shifting process can stop when `i` reaches 1 because index 0 will be handled separately (by wrapping the last element).",
          "conceptual_gap": "The loop condition `while (i > 0)` correctly iterates from `n-1` down to `1`. However, the core logic of shifting right requires copying the element at `i-1` into `i`. When `i=1` (the final iteration), the code executes `numbers[1] = numbers[0]` (copying 0 into 1). The actual array element that should be involved in the shift process is `numbers[0]` itself, which needs to be copied into `numbers[1]`. The loop structure works as intended for the shift part, but the conceptual gap lies in not properly identifying a specific misconception in the shifting logic *structure* itself, as the implementation provided is actually the standard correct way to perform an array right shift in place (by working backwards from the end and handling the wrap separately), assuming the indices and loop boundaries are correct. In this case, the implementation is **correct** for the requirement.",
