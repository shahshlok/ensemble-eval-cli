          "conceptual_gap": "While the code does work correctly in this case, it reflects a misunderstanding of loop mechanics. Setting `i = n` doesn't 'break' the loop\u2014it just ensures the while condition becomes false on the next check. This is an indirect and non-idiomatic way to exit a loop early. The student should use a `break` statement, which is the Java standard for early loop termination.

The student treats the iteration variable as the primary mechanism for loop control, extending its use beyond simple iteration management to also handle immediate termination.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student's model lacks knowledge of proper control flow statements intended for early termination, specifically the `break` statement.
