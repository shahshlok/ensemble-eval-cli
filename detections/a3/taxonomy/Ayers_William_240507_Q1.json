          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that printing the required output, such as '-1' when the target is not found, should be done literally as specified, even if it contradicts the expected output format for the 'found' case. Specifically, they fail to recognize the need to include the introductory text 'Found at index: ' when the element is found, but correctly deduce that only '-1' should be printed when not found.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student correctly uses an `if/else` structure to manage the two distinct output conditions (found vs. not found). However, the output formatting logic is inconsistent. If the element is found (k != -1), the prompt requires 'Found at index: [index]', but if not found (k == -1), the prompt requires only '-1'. The student implements the '-1' case as a standalone output, but in the 'found' case, they incorrectly combine the index output with the required prefix, leading to a format mismatch for the not-found scenario relative to the prompt's implied requirement structure.",
          "error_manifestation": "Wrong output formatting when the target is not found (prints '-1' instead of the required 'index: -1' format), or when the target is found but the prompt implies only one printing style.",
