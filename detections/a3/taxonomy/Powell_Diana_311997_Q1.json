          "conceptual_gap": "The student has an insufficiently clear model of the `break` statement's effect. The `break` command guarantees immediate termination of the search loop upon the first match. Since the check `if (currentArrayValue == targetValue)` occurs only once per element, and `break` is executed immediately after the assignment, the index is guaranteed to be overwritten only once (from -1 to the found index). The inner check is therefore logically redundant. This suggests the student is over-engineering state protection rather than relying on efficient control flow.",

They seem to think that because we are looking for the *first* occurrence, the moment the match is found, any assignment to the index must be definitive, making the conditional assignment (L50-L52) redundant or harmless, but not strictly necessary for correctness.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In reality, the logic is sound but overly complex and shows a misunderstanding of how a simple linear search for the *first* item should be structured. Because of the `if (firstOccurrenceIndex == -1)` check (L50), the student suggests that they are worried about overwriting a previously found index, which is impossible in a linear search using 'break'. They are unnecessarily using a state-tracking variable (L39) inside the loop for control flow (L50) when the simple `break` mechanism already guarantees 'first occurrence' execution.",
          "error_manifestation": "The code currently works correctly, as the conditional assignment inside the loop (L50-L52) is always true on the first hit, and the `break` immediately terminates the loop.
