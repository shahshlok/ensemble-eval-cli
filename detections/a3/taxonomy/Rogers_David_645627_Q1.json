They do not recognize or utilize mechanisms for immediate flow interruption.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student successfully uses the flag `y` in the `while` condition (`y==-1`) to ensure early exit on the next iteration check. However, they neglect to use the `break` statement immediately after finding the target (`y=i`). This results in unnecessary execution of the counter increment (`i++`) after the result has been found, reflecting a mental model where the computer cannot interrupt the current sequential block execution based on newly updated conditions.",
          "error_manifestation": "Functionally correct, but inefficient and non-idiomatic implementation for early exiting a search loop. The index `i` is unnecessarily incremented even when the target is found.",

          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that incrementing the loop control variable (`i`) after checking the exit condition (`i<n&&y==-1`) but before the conditional assignment (`if(a[i]==t)y=i;`) will not affect the core logic of the search, specifically that the loop index `i` used for array access will remain synchronized with its intended position, even if the loop terminates early due to finding the target.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The Java execution model requires careful sequencing of modifications to loop control variables. In the student's code, when the target is found and `y` is set to `i`, the subsequent unconditional `i++` (Line 15) executes *before* the loop condition is re-evaluated, causing `i` to point one index past the index where the element was found. While this does not affect the correctness of the *output index* stored in `y`, it reflects a slightly insecure mental model of how control flow and simultaneous variable updates interact at loop boundaries, specifically how the early termination condition interacts with the final index update.",
          "error_manifestation": "Subtle error avoidance (Code works but relies on the post-condition check). The student structure is slightly confusing because the increment happens even if the target is found, making the loop index `i` inaccurate relative to the found index `y` upon exit.",
