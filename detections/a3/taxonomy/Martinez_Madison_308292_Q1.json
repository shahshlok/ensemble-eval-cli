          "conceptual_gap": "The student confuses the requirement of finding the *first* occurrence with merely finding *an* occurrence and recording its index. While the logic `if (current == target && index == -1)` correctly ensures `index` is only set once (to the first found index), the flaw is that the loop continues after the index is found. Although the code *technically* outputs the correct index because `index` is only updated when it is `-1`, the design choice to iterate through the whole array when a simple `break` or `return` would suffice indicates a misunderstanding of efficient search logic or an over-reliance on post-loop logic when immediate termination is required for optimization (and sometimes correctness, though not in this specific implementation). The core gap is confusing the need for immediate termination (which is standard for 'first occurrence' search algorithms) with recording the answer and checking the outcome later.",

          "conceptual_gap": "The key conceptual gap is the lack of understanding regarding efficient loop termination when searching for the first element. In actual Java execution, once the first element is found (which satisfies the problem constraints), the loop should immediately terminate (using `break` or modifying the loop condition). The student's model forces them to iterate through all elements, requiring an extra check (`index == -1`) to ensure they only record the index once, which is inefficient and unnecessary if proper termination handling were used (e.g., a `break` or a `for` loop structure suitable for early exit).",
