          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, array elements can be accessed and compared directly using their index (e.g., `studentScores[innerIndex] > studentScores[innerIndex + 1]`). Assigning array elements to local variables like `a` and `b` is unnecessary overhead and can decrease readability without providing any execution benefit. The fundamental concept missed is that array elements are themselves first-class variables accessible via indexing.",

Furthermore, the student assigns the values to 'a' and 'b' and then immediately compares them (if (a > b)) and proceeds to swap the *array* elements (studentScores[innerIndex] and studentScores[innerIndex + 1]) without ever using 'a' or 'b' in the actual swap logic. This suggests a misunderstanding of variable scope or a confusion between using local copies versus directly manipulating array data.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In reality, the local variables 'a' and 'b' are copies of the array values at that specific iteration and scope. They serve no functional purpose other than temporary storage for the comparison condition, as the subsequent swap logic completely ignores them and accesses the array elements directly. This wastefully introduces unnecessary local variable operations which Java typically optimizes away but indicates a conceptual clutter in the student's process regarding variable necessity and direct array manipulation.",
