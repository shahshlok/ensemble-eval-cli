          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that the array processing logic (the shifting loop) must be conditional on the size being greater than zero, even though array initialization and input reading already handle N=0 implicitly (using new int[0]). While the shifting logic itself is safe (since N=0 means the loops won't run), placing the logic inside an 'if (N > 0)' block suggests a perceived vulnerability when N=0, which is unnecessary boilerplate if a clean zero-element array print is the expected default.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student has a mental model where certain operations must be explicitly guarded against an empty array (N=0) to prevent errors, even when the default behavior of Java's control flow structures (like `for` loops) naturally handles such cases safely. The actual Java execution model processes the flow correctly regardless of the redundant check.",
