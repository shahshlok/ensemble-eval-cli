          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that calling 'break' inside a loop designed to find the first occurrence automatically stops the entire search process in a way that preserves the desired result (the index of the first match). They correctly identify that 'break' is necessary to stop the loop when a match is found, but they do not account for the possibility that the array might be empty or the input size 'n' might be zero.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student has a gap in understanding boundary conditions and program robustness. While the logic works for non-empty arrays where the target is found, the initialization `int index = -1;` correctly handles the 'not found' case. The actual flaw lies in the lack of explicit checks for edge cases like `n=0` or input validation, although for this specific problem (assuming valid inputs), the core logic is actually correct: initialization to -1, iteration, assignment upon match, and immediate break ensures the index of the *first* match is stored.",
          "error_manifestation": "No functional error for valid inputs, but demonstrates incomplete thinking about boundary conditions (e.g., handling N=0 or N=negative) which is often associated with fragile mental models of array traversal. However, if we focus strictly on the goal (find the *first* occurrence), the logic is sound.",
