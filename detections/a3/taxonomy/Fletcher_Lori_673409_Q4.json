They correctly implemented the printing loop but seem to have based the conditional check for spaces on the general 'iterate and check for last element' approach, even though the problem description and sample output imply standard output formatting.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student's implementation of the final printing loop includes explicit checks (`if (i < n - 1)`) to avoid printing a trailing space, which is good practice. However, since the provided sample output shows this behavior (spaces *between* numbers, not after the last one), this is not a conceptual error in programming logic, but rather a slight deviation from the simplest possible print loop (which would just print elements followed by a space). Since the shift logic itself is correct, and the printing logic is also correct (it produces the desired output format), there is no discernible *notional machine* misconception in this student code related to array logic or execution flow.",
