They fail to rely solely on the combination of sequential iteration and the `break` condition to ensure the 'first' index is found.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student does not fully trust the control flow mechanism provided by the `break` statement in conjunction with linear search. Since the loop starts at index 0 and immediately terminates via `break` upon finding the first match, `firstOccurrenceIndex` is guaranteed to be `-1` at that point. The inner conditional check (`if (firstOccurrenceIndex == -1)`) is redundant, indicating a flawed mental model regarding the guarantees provided by sequential iteration combined with immediate termination.",

The condition `if (firstOccurrenceIndex == -1)` inside the loop after breaking is logically redundant because: (1) the variable is only modified in this one location, and (2) the break statement immediately exits the loop, preventing any further iterations that could trigger this code again.",
