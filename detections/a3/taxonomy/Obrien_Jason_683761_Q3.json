They may be hesitant to remove code that they perceive as fundamental or necessary boilerplate.",

The Java execution model only processes instructions that lead to the desired outcome. The integer calculations performed in lines 9-11 are entirely decoupled from the subsequent String operations and constitute dead code that serves no purpose in fulfilling the assignment's requirements.",

The unused variables suggest the student either: (1) is testing basic arithmetic syntax before tackling the main task, (2) misunderstands the scope of the problem, or (3) hasn't properly planned their solution before coding. This indicates a lack of understanding that code should be purposeful and every variable declaration should be intentional.",
