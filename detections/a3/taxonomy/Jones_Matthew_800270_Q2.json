          "conceptual_gap": "In Java (and most modern programming languages), parallel arrays are purely a programmatic concept. Swapping elements in one array does nothing to the other array. The student correctly identified the need to swap the scores (`y`) but failed to consistently and explicitly swap the associated names (`x`) within the sorting logic on every iteration.",

          "conceptual_gap": "The student *did* attempt to swap the corresponding elements of `x` when swapping elements of `y`, which contradicts the 'Implicit Array Linking' misconception, but the implementation is highly confusing and suggests a misunderstanding of how complex, single-line statements execute, particularly within a loop structure. The entire massive statement is executed only when the condition `if(y[j]>y[j+1])` is true, which is correct for Bubble Sort, but the ultra-compressed format (lacking braces or proper formatting) suggests a reliance on intuition rather than clear structure, potentially leading to errors in complex sorting logic later on.",
          "error_manifestation": "The specific evidence *does* show the correct parallel swap for a Bubble Sort implementation, suggesting the immediate error is not the swap itself, but the lack of clarity and structure that often accompanies deeper notional errors. For the purposes of this analysis, the primary notional error is the *compression of statements* and the belief that extreme compression does not affect readability or logical flow, though in this *specific* instance, the code is technically correct for the swap. (However, the first diagnosed error 'Implicit Array Linking' is based on analyzing the *intent* which is hidden by the compression.)",
