          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that in order to compare two values (an array element `arr[i]` and the target `t`), they must first declare and assign these values to new local variables (`a` and `b`) before performing the equality check. This suggests an unnecessary step in their mental model of variable handling or comparison operation, perhaps viewing the comparison operator (`==`) only working on simple, single-character variable names or needing a dedicated 'comparison scope'.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In reality, the `if` condition could directly compare `arr[i] == t`. The creation of temporary variables `a` and `b` (lines 20-21) is functionally redundant, demonstrating a conceptual overhead in the student's idea of how values are processed for comparison. Java allows direct comparison of any two compatible expressions.",

          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that the standard way to exit a loop upon finding an element, especially in a simple console application, is by using a combination of the loop condition (`i < n`) and an external flag (`index == -1`) to manage termination. This shows a preference for manipulating control flow variables over using simpler built-in mechanisms like the `break` statement when iterating over a collection.",
          "conceptual_gap": "While the student's approach (lines 18-25) is functionally correct for finding the *first* occurrence, the more idiomatic and conceptually simpler way to stop searching immediately upon finding the target would be to use a `break` statement inside the `if (a == b)` block. The student's use of redundant variables (`a`, `b`) and reliance on the compound loop condition (`index == -1`) suggests they overlook or have not internalized the power of immediate loop termination.",
