          "conceptual_gap": "In Java's imperative execution model, `arr[i]` is assigned the value resulting from the evaluation of `arr[i-1]`. Since `int` is a primitive type, this is a clean value copy. The intermediate local variable `a` is entirely unnecessary and does not clarify the execution state of the array, nor does it prevent any error. The student's model adds a layer of abstraction (the temporary variable `a`) where none is needed, implying uncertainty about how sequential assignments within a loop modify memory.",
