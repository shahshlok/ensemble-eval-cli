          "conceptual_gap": "The student understands the sequence of operations (uppercase then replace) but implements it with maximum decomposition. While not strictly incorrect, it suggests they may not grasp Java's capability for method chaining on immutable objects, which would simplify Steps 4 and 5 into one or two variables. This, combined with the successful modification, suggests an overuse of distinct variables rather than a fundamental error in state mutation, as the note about immutability was correctly handled.",
