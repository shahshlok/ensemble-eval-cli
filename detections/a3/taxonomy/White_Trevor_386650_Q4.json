They may fear that a direct assignment like `arr[i] = arr[i-1]` could lead to unexpected behavior or interfere with sequential execution flow in a way that temporary variables prevent.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In the Java execution model, the simple assignment statement `arr[i] = arr[i - 1]` executes sequentially. The right side (`arr[i - 1]`) is fully evaluated (its value is read from memory) before the left side (`arr[i]`) is assigned. The intermediate `temp_holder` variable is redundant because the direct assignment already guarantees that the original value of `arr[i-1]` is used, regardless of the loop structure.",

However, this is unnecessary work\u2014they could directly assign `arr[i] = arr[i-1]` without the intermediate variable. The student appears to have a mental model where direct assignment feels unsafe, requiring a 'holding' step.

While temporary variables are crucial for swaps, they are redundant when merely copying `arr[i-1]` to `arr[i]`.
