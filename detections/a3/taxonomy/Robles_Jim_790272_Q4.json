          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that the loop condition `while (shiftIndex > 0)` correctly handles the entire range of indices that need to be shifted, stopping exactly before trying to shift the element at index 0 into index 0.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The actual shift operation is `userInputArray[shiftIndex] = userInputArray[shiftIndex - 1];`. When `shiftIndex` starts at `arraySize - 1` and counts down, this assignment correctly handles the shifting of elements up to filling index 1 with the value from index 0. However, the condition `shiftIndex > 0` means the loop stops when `shiftIndex` becomes 0, preventing the element at index 0 from being accessed and shifted. The student has implemented the shift correctly without needing to re-read the index 0 value, but the flaw is that the loop *only* needs to run until `shiftIndex` is 1 (to move element[0] to element[1]), which is what the current loop does. The code is actually logically correct regarding the shift range, which makes finding a notional misconception tricky, as the implementation works as intended for the shift part. The code is *correct* for the shift operation, suggesting no notional machine error here, but rather a robust, albeit slightly verbose, implementation.",
