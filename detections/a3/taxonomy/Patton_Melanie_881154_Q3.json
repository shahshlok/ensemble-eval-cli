          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that string methods like `toUpperCase()` and `replace()` are separate computational steps that require assigning their output to a completely new variable name (a, b, result) sequentially. Although the underlying realization that a new String must be created is present (as implied by the correct use of assignment), the verbose assignment chain suggests a cautious approach where they might feel reusing the original variable name `input_line` for intermediate steps would modify the original string, or worse, they do not realize the results of chained methods can be directly assigned to one variable.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The note explicitly mentioned that Strings are immutable. While the student's code enforces immutability by creating new strings (`a`, `b`, `result`), their method of achieving the final `result` is excessively verbose. They fail to utilize the simplest form of reassignment, such as `input_line = input_line.toUpperCase().replace(\" \", \"_\");`, potentially believing that variables `a` and `b` are strictly necessary, perhaps due to a mild confusion between modifying the input (which is impossible) and using the variable name to store the new string reference (which is fine). This suggests a weak understanding of how references and reassignment interact with immutability, even if the final code produces the correct functional outcome.",
