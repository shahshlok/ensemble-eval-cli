          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that printing -1 must be handled separately using `System.out.println(\"-1\")` when no match is found, but when a match is found (when `z` is the index), they need to include the required prefix 'Found at index: ' before printing the variable value `z`. This separation implies a misunderstanding of how the final output string structure should be handled based on success or failure, potentially confusing the requirement to print only '-1' vs. the requirement to print a formatted string.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The conceptual gap lies in correctly interpreting the output requirements, specifically that if the target is not found, *only* '-1' should be printed, and otherwise, the formatted output should be printed. The student correctly implements the logic, but the actual printing statements are slightly redundant and overly complex for the intended output style, suggesting a misunderstanding of how the program needs to discriminate completely different output formats (-1 vs. 'Found at index: [index]'). Although the code works, the structure reflects a cognitive split between two distinct output scenarios rather than realizing that `z` holds all necessary information.",
