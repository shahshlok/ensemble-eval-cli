When they set arr[i+1] = arr[i] in a backwards loop starting from i = N-2 down to i = 0, they overwrite arr[1] with arr[0], then arr[2] with arr[1] (which was already arr[0]), etc. However, the critical flaw is that arr[N-1] gets overwritten in the FIRST iteration when i = N-2, resulting in arr[N-1] = arr[N-2]. This causes data loss. The student should have realized that arr[N-1] was already saved in variable `a`, so the loop should only go from N-2 down to 0, which it does\u2014but this still overwrites the last element immediately. The actual issue: they need to NOT increment the index in the assignment (arr[i+1]) but rather decrement it, OR they need to understand that iterating backwards requires careful boundary management.",
