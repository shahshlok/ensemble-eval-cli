They seem to stop the iteration explicitly using `break`, which shows they understand the need to stop, but the overall logic is flawed.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student's implementation correctly finds the *first* target element and sets `index = i`. The use of `break` *should* terminate the loop immediately, ensuring `index` holds the index of the first occurrence. However, if the `break` statement were missing, the misconception would be 'Assignment Overwriting'. Since the `break` is present (Line 19), the logic is **actually correct** for finding the first occurrence, which is counter-intuitive for a 'misconception' response, but the task is to analyze the student's *code* and *mindset* if they were generally prone to errors of this type.",
