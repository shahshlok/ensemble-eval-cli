          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that using the 'break' statement within a loop searching for the first occurrence of an item guarantees that the search stops immediately, but they fail to initialize or manage the 'found_index' variable correctly to ensure it only stores data from the *first* successful iteration if the search continued after the break, or they simply misunderstand how loops interact with break when trying to find the first match.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The core problem requires finding the *first* occurrence. The student correctly uses `break` (line 27) to stop the search immediately upon finding a match. However, because they only update `found_index` inside the loop (line 26) and then break, the value of `found_index` correctly holds the index of the first match. There is no fundamental notional misconception about how iteration works or how `break` functions in this specific context, as the logic correctly solves the problem as stated (finding the *first* occurrence).",
