          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that when sorting an array of size N, the inner loop comparison indexing `innerIndex < numberOfStudents - 1 - outerIndex` is correct, but they overlook that the comparison `studentScores[innerIndex + 1]` inside the loop can access an index beyond the array bounds (i.e., `numberOfStudents` which is an invalid index) if the outer loop does not adjust the bounds correctly, or if the indices are not handled precisely.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In bubble sort for an array of size N, the outer loop iterates N-1 times. The inner loop compares `A[i]` and `A[i+1]`. If the inner loop iterates up to `i < limit`, then `i+1` must be less than N. The student uses `numberOfStudents - 1 - outerIndex` as the strict upper bound for `innerIndex` on line 34, which is technically correct logic for standard Bubble Sort to ensure `innerIndex + 1` does not exceed `array.length - 1`. However, since the code snippet is correct and functional for sorting, any observed error in execution, such as a potential `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`, is preempted by the correct implementation of the algorithm bounds. Since the logic is technically correct for the provided implementation of bubble sort, I cannot confidently attribute a misconception here based on the code evidence.",
