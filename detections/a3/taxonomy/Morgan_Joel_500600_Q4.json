This suggests they are generalizing the rule for variable swapping (where a temp variable is strictly necessary) to simple copy operations where it is redundant.",

The statement `numbers[i] = numbers[i - 1];` evaluates `numbers[i - 1]` completely before writing the result to `numbers[i]`. Since `numbers[i - 1]` is not modified during this single step, there is no risk of losing its value, and the intermediate `temp` variable is entirely unnecessary.

The temporary variable is actually unnecessary because numbers[i-1] is being read and immediately assigned to numbers[i] without any risk of data loss.

They think the backwards loop naturally prevents overwriting issues, but they don't realize their logic just copies each element to the position of the next element, progressively losing data.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The core issue is that the student's algorithm doesn't actually perform a right shift\u2014it performs a left-copy operation in reverse order. When numbers[i] = numbers[i-1] executes, it copies the left element rightward, but since this happens for all positions in the loop, the first element's value gets copied to position 1, then that same first element's value (now in position 1) should influence position 2, but the original position 1 value has been lost. The correct approach requires understanding that a right shift means: 'copy each element to the position to its right,' not 'copy the left neighbor to each position.'",
