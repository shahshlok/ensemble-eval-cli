The condition `i < n` (or `0 < 0`) fails immediately, and the loop body is safely skipped without needing an external `if` block.

In reality, a standard `for` loop condition (`i < n`) naturally prevents indexing an empty array (`n=0`) and prevents the loop body from executing, meaning the explicit `if (n != 0)` check on lines 21 and 22 is redundant and the initialization of `foundIndex = -1` (line 19) is sufficient to cover the empty array case without the explicit check.",

          "conceptual_gap": "The student implements specialized if/else logic (lines 29-33) to handle the output strings based on whether the index is -1 or found at a valid index. While correct, this obscures the fact that the output for the 'not found' case requires printing only the value of the index variable itself (`foundIndex`). Had the requirement been simply 'Print foundIndex', the code could be simplified. However, since the sample output requires 'Found at index: X' or just '-1', they introduce branching where simpler logic might suffice if the requirements were interpreted differently. Specifically, lines 31-33 print the literal string \"-1\" when `foundIndex` is -1, rather than printing the contents of the variable `foundIndex` which is already -1.",
