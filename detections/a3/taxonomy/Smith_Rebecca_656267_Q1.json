The student's code complicates this by using an `if/else` block based on whether the index is -1 to choose which output string to use.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The assignment requires two distinct output formats: 'Found at index: [index]' (when found) or just '-1' (when not found). The student correctly initialized the index to -1, which is the required output for the 'not found' case. The actual requirement for the 'not found' case (printing -1) is already satisfied by the value of `firstOccurrenceIndex`. Therefore, the student's final `else` block is redundant and overly defensive, reflecting a lack of confidence in the initial setup or a misunderstanding of how to fulfill the exact output specification when a default value serves as a sentinel.",

          "conceptual_gap": "The student misunderstands or overcomplicates the required output logic. Since the variable `firstOccurrenceIndex` is initialized to -1 (the 'not found' value) and is only updated upon finding the target, the final value of this single variable (either the index or -1) is sufficient to fulfill the requirement. The explicit `if/else` block based on `firstOccurrenceIndex != -1` is logically sound but adds unnecessary complexity because the requirement for 'not found' is simply to print '-1', which is already the value of the variable in that path.",
