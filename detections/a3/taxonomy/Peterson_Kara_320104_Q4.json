This indicates a misunderstanding of which values need saving/caching during an array shift operation.",

          "conceptual_gap": "While checking for `n > 1` (line 19) prevents runtime errors if the array is size 0 or 1, the check at line 14 (`if (n < 0)`) is unnecessary defensive programming for standard integer input, suggesting a belief that the system needs explicit protection against highly unlikely or trivial/handled inputs. More critically, the shifting logic (lines 20-25) is entirely encapsulated within the `if (n > 1)` block, indicating the student struggled to generalize the shifting concept across array sizes, rather than relying on the loop structure (`while (i > 0)`) to correctly handle the boundary conditions implicitly.",
