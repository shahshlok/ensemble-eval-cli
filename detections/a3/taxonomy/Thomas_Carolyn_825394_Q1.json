          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that printing text to the console manages stream separation automatically, or that using `System.out.print()` is functionally equivalent to `System.out.println()` for the purpose of primary program output. They likely expect the console environment or the preceding input operations to implicitly handle line breaks (newlines).",
          "conceptual_gap": "The Java execution model requires explicit instruction, either via `System.out.println()` or by adding the newline character `\\n`, to change the state of the output stream and advance the cursor to the next line. By using only `System.out.print()` throughout the program, the output, including prompts and final results, runs together contiguously, violating the typical expectation for formatted terminal output.",

          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that printing the final result requires using an explicit `if(z == -1)` check, but fails to recognize that if the main success branch (`else System.out.print(\"Found at index: \"+z);`) executes, the code flow should prevent the preceding success messages from running outside of the successful path. The student believes that placing the negative result printing (`System.out.print(\"-1\");`) inside the specific `if (z == -1)` block is sufficient to handle the negative case, but overlooks placing the positive success message inside an `else` block or ensuring that only one output path is taken, leading to potentially verbose or incorrect output if the code had continued.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student successfully used `break` to exit the loop upon finding the first element, which correctly identifies the index. However, the logic for outputting the result is slightly flawed in structure, specifically relying on two separate `if/else` checks for output rather than realizing that only one final output (either found or not found) is needed and should be structured cleanly. While `z` is correctly initialized to `-1`, the explicit check `if(z==-1)` followed by an `else` branch handles the specific required output correctly, masking a potential conceptual gap regarding general execution flow structure, although in this specific case, the behavior is correct.",
          "error_manifestation": "None. The code produces the correct output because the logic flow happens to work, but the structure suggests reliance on default behaviors rather than crisp control flow.",
