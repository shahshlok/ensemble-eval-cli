          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, assigning a new value to a loop control variable doesn't immediately exit the loop. The assignment `j = n` occurs, but the loop continues to evaluate the condition `j < n` at the next iteration. The student appears to be trying to achieve early termination (breaking out when the target is found) but is using assignment instead of an actual `break` statement. While this code happens to work correctly because the condition will be false on the next check, it demonstrates a misunderstanding of loop control flow.",

They seem to treat the `while` loop structure as a sequence of conditional checks where execution flow is strictly determined by nested `if/else` structures, without fully modeling the implicit increment/decrement necessary for the loop to naturally terminate if not explicitly exited.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student fails to recognize that setting `j = n` inside the `if` block effectively stops *further* iterations only when the loop condition (`j < n`) is checked again at the start of the next iteration. They still need to ensure that the variable controlling iteration (`j`) advances correctly when the condition is *not* met. The current setup is redundant and potentially confusing: if the target is found, `j` jumps to `n` and the loop terminates. If the target is not found, `j` increments (`j = j + 1`). This implementation is technically correct for termination but shows a reliance on manually escaping the loop using the control variable rather than relying on a `break` statement or an equivalent structure (like a `for` loop with a flag). Although it works, it suggests an undeveloped mental model of standard search loop structures.",
