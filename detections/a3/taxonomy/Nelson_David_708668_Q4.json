          "conceptual_gap": "The Java execution model allows for direct assignment between array indices (`arr[i] = arr[i-1]`), which is the standard and efficient mechanism for shifting elements. The student's introduction of the redundant `temp` variable inside the loop (Lines 25-26) demonstrates a flawed, over-complicated mental model of simple variable assignment and data movement, perceiving it as a two-step transfer perhaps out of concern for data corruption or lack of confidence in the atomicity of direct assignment.",

          "conceptual_gap": "The assignment operation in Java (`arr[i] = arr[i - 1];`) is atomic for primitive types and simply performs a value copy. There is no risk of the original value at `arr[i - 1]` being 'used up' or changed by this read-assignment operation.
