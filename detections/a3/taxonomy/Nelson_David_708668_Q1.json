          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that printing the specific string 'Found at index: X' when the target is found, and printing only '-1' when the target is not found, satisfies all requirements of the problem. They overlooked the requirement that if the target is not found, the output should *only* be the value -1.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The problem specification requires printing the string 'Found at index: I' if found, and *just* the number '-1' if not found. The student correctly handles the 'found' case but adds unnecessary output in the 'not found' case. If the target is not found (e.g., target 99), the code outputs:\n\nIf found (indexFound != -1):\nSystem.out.println(\"Found at index: \" + indexFound);\n\nIf not found (indexFound == -1):\nSystem.out.println(-1);\n\nThis implementation is logically correct according to the sample run, which uses `Found at index: 1` and implies the 'not found' case should just print the index (-1). The provided sample output, however, doesn't show the 'not found' case clearly leading to ambiguity. Based strictly on the sample run's printing format, the 'not found' output should be consistent. The student code's logic is actually fine based on standard requirements, but the output structure is slightly verbose compared to typical competitive programming requirements where only -1 is expected when not found.",
