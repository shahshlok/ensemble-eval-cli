          "conceptual_gap": "The student correctly uses a flag (the `index` variable initialized to -1) and uses `break` to exit the loop upon finding a match. However, the use of `break` *guarantees* that the loop terminates immediately upon finding the first match. The resulting `index` is correct because the loop iterates sequentially from index 0 upwards. This code, despite the initial analysis, is actually logically correct for finding the first occurrence. There is no notional machine misconception present in the logic used to solve the problem.",
