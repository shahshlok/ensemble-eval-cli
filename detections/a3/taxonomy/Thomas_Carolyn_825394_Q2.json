The student has correctly implemented the Bubble Sort swap logic for the 'scores' array (z) but has implemented an incomplete swap logic for the 'names' array (y) which is missing the logic for the temporary variable.

The String swap logic (`String s=y[j];y[j]=y[j+1];y[j+1]=s;`) executes unconditionally (always runs).
