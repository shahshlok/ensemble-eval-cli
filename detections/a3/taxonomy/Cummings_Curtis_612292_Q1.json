          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that in a search loop, setting the result variable (c) inside the conditional block is insufficient to ensure that the variable holds the 'first' found index. They enforce immediate loop termination via `break` as a critical part of the definition of 'first occurrence', potentially viewing `break` not just as an optimization or flow control, but as a necessary semantic certification required to fix the value of `c` before other elements can overwrite it, even if they correctly implemented the search. This hints at incomplete trust in the iterative nature of the loop state management.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student correctly uses `break` to achieve the desired outcome (finding the first instance). However, if the belief stems from distrust in how iteration updates a variable, they conflate the required logical outcome ('find first') with the specific implementation tool (`break`). The core confusion lies in understanding that sequential variable assignment inside a loop naturally finds the *last* valid assignment executed, and `break` is needed to prevent subsequent assignments, rather than simply 'certifying' the current assignment. While the tool is used correctly, the underlying mental model might be prescriptive rather than reasoned.",
