This suggests they may either be unaware of the `break` statement or intentionally avoiding it, viewing the loop control variable itself as the primary mechanism for immediate termination.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student lacks knowledge or confidence in using the standard Java control flow mechanism (`break`) which is designed to exit loops immediately. While setting `j = n` achieves the goal of finding the *first* occurrence and preventing further iteration, it is non-idiomatic and inefficient compared to `break`, demonstrating a gap in understanding how to leverage Java's structural features for flow control optimization.",

However, this is a somewhat fragile/non-idiomatic way to break from a loop. The student should use a 'break' statement instead. The code functions correctly but shows the student may not fully grasp that 'break' is the standard Java mechanism for early loop termination.

The use of j = n to force exit indicates the student wanted to ensure index isn't overwritten, but this is defensive programming rather than clear algorithmic thinking. A clearer approach would use 'break' immediately after finding the match, showing confident understanding that we only need to find and report the first match.",
