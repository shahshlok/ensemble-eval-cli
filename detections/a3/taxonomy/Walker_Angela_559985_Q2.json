When the student executes `a=s[i]; b=s[j];`, `a` and `b` hold copies of the scores. The lines `s[i]=b; s[j]=a;` are necessary and correctly perform the numerical swap, but the preceding lines `a=s[i]; b=s[j];` followed by the conditional modification of `a` and `b` demonstrate that the student fundamentally misunderstood how auxiliary variables used for swapping should interact with the final assignment statement. The student copies the values into `a` and `b`, compares `a` and `b`, but then correctly implements a swap using `a` and `b` as the source values *for the swap*, effectively ignoring the purpose of the classic swap pattern and using `a` and `b` redundant intermediate holder/temporary variables used for comparison only.",

The code fails to implement a correct comparison and swap block because `a` and `b` are not used as temporary storage for the required swap logic (which uses a single temporary variable `t` for the names, but attempts to use `a` and `b` incorrectly for scores), although the final assignments `s[i]=b; s[j]=a;` accidentally achieve the correct score swap.",
