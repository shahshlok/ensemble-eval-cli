          "conceptual_gap": "The student successfully implemented the core circular shift logic. The error is a minor logical failure in the output loop's structuring, specifically a failure to handle the spacing correctly to match the sample run output format for arrays. For the input '1 2 3 4', the loop correctly prints '4 1 2 3' but with no spaces, resulting in '4123'. The condition `if(i!=n-1)` correctly identifies indices that *shouldn't* be followed by a space (the last one), but the basic printing of the element is not followed by a space for indices that *should* be followed by one. The common correct pattern is to print the space *before* the element for all indices `i > 0`.",

If the student guarantees that `n` is non-negative (by coercing negatives to 0) before `new int[n]`, the program will not crash during initialization. The issue is purely defensive programming leading to potentially complex flow control (`if(n!=0)`), which isn't strictly necessary if the input validation focused on gracefully exiting or prompting again, rather than defaulting to size zero.",

          "conceptual_gap": "In Java (and most imperative languages), local variables are scoped to their block or method. When a variable like `i` is used in multiple sequential `while` loops, it needs to be explicitly reset if it is reused for a new full iteration starting from 0 (or n-1). The student explicitly resets `i` (lines 15 and 20), demonstrating awareness, but uses `while` loops styled in a way that avoids using the clearer `for` loop syntax, which naturally organizes initialization, conditional checking, and iteration step.",
