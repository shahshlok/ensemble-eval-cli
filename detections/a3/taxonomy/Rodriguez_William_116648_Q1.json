The student doesn't understand that directly using N as the loop bound and initializing c = -1 inline is both simpler and more idiomatic.

This suggests a habit of setting up variables derived from input size for bounds, even if the primary loop index covers this role, possibly mimicking aspects of binary search initialization (lower/upper bound) or overcomplicating simple linear search setup.",

The variables `a` and `b` add unnecessary complexity without changing the program's logic. Using `i = a` and `i < b` is functionally identical to using `i = 0` and `i < N` in this context, demonstrating a lack of understanding of minimal setup for a linear search.",
