Creating `a = 0` and `b = N` doesn't add any functionality\u2014it's equivalent to using the literals directly. This suggests a possible misunderstanding of variable scope/lifetime, or perhaps overthinking the 'abstraction' benefits of variables. More concerning is using `c = -1` as an output variable, which works but indicates the student may not fully understand that the loop must execute and conditionally update `c`, or they're treating `c` like a container that will 'automatically' hold the result.",
          "error_manifestation": "Code runs correctly but shows a mental model issue: the student is using variables as if they need to 'prepare' storage before logic executes, rather than understanding variables as direct storage within execution flow.

This is actually correct behavior, but the pattern suggests the student may be thinking of `c` as a 'placeholder' that exists independently of the loop's execution, rather than as a variable whose value is determined by control flow.",
          "conceptual_gap": "While the initialization strategy (`c = -1` before the loop) is a valid approach and the code works correctly, the mental model may reflect a weaker understanding of why this pattern works: the student might believe the initial value 'persists' unless overwritten, rather than understanding that the variable's value at any point is determined by the most recent assignment or initialization in the execution path.",
