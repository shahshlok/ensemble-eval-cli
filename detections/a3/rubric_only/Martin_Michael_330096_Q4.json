          "description": "When parsing coordinates from the input strings 'p1', 'p2', and 'p3', the student assumes the input format is exactly two single-digit characters per coordinate pair and attempts to convert the character ASCII values to numbers by subtracting '0' (an old C technique). This method only works for single digits '0' through '9' and is fragile, especially since 'nextLine()' would read text like '(1, 2)' where the coordinates are not necessarily the first two characters.",
