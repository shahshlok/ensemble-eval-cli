It never reads a single integer N, never uses loops to print rows of '*', and only outputs a numeric area result.\n\nRubric grading:\n- Reading height N from input (1.0 pts): 0/1 \u2014 The code reads six double coordinates (x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3) rather than a single integer height N.\n- Outer loop handling N rows (1.0 pts): 0/1 \u2014 There is no loop over rows; the code does not attempt to iterate from row 1 to N.\n- Inner loop for printing stars (2.0 pts): 0/2 \u2014 The program never prints '*' characters in any loop; it only prints prompt text and the area.\n- Correct pattern (1.0 pts): 0/1 \u2014 No right triangle pattern is produced; output is a single line with the area.\n- Newline after each row (1.0 pts): 0/1 \u2014 Since no rows are printed, there are no per-row newlines to format the triangle.\n\nTotal score: 0/6.\n\nOverall feedback: Your program solves a different problem (computing triangle area from coordinates) instead of printing the required '*' right triangle pattern.
