          "description": "The assignment requires a number guessing game where the computer picks a random secret integer between 1 and 100 using something like `Random rand = new Random(); int answer = rand.nextInt(100) + 1;`, then repeatedly asks the user to guess until they are correct.\n\nExpected algorithm (for this task and overall behavior):\n1. Create a Random object.\n2. Generate an integer `answer` between 1 and 100 inclusive.\n3. Initialize a guess counter.\n4. In a loop: prompt the user for a guess, read the guess, compare it to `answer`.\n   - If guess < answer: print \"Too low!\".\n   - If guess > answer: print \"Too high!\".\n   - If guess == answer: print a correct message with the number of guesses and terminate.\n\nWhat the student's code actually does:\n- Declares class `RoadTripCost` and a `main` method.\n- Creates a `Scanner`.\n- Prompts for driving distance, miles per gallon, and price per gallon.\n- Computes `gallonsNeeded = distance / mpg` and `cost = gallonsNeeded * price`.\n- Prints debug information and the final trip cost.\n- Closes the scanner.\n\nThere is no `Random` object, no `answer` variable, and no game state representing a secret number. Instead, the program implements a completely different problem (road trip cost calculator). This is not a small omission; the core requirement of having the computer choose a number is missing.\n\nDiagnosis of WHY:\n- This is a procedural/conceptual mismatch with the problem specification, not a syntax issue.\n- The student appears to either have pasted a solution for another assignment or not understood that the program must contain internal game state (a computer-chosen number) rather than only user-provided values.\n\nFrom the student's perspective (inferred belief):\n- The student seems to believe that: \"For this task, it is enough to ask the user for several numeric inputs, do a calculation, and print a result; the computer does not need to choose its own random number.\"\n\nCorrect understanding:\n- The computer must generate and store a secret random number using `Random` and an `int` variable before any guesses are read. This `answer` is then used for all comparisons with the user's guesses.\n\nRubric impact for this task:\n- Category: \"Generating random number (1-100)\".\n- Score: 0/1, because no random number or corresponding variable is present at all.",
