The student unnecessarily creates three separate variables (`y`, `n`, `z`) where two would suffice to hold the input and the final result, demonstrating a preference for creating intermediate variables for every step rather than variable reuse via re-assignment (e.g., `y = y.toUpperCase(); y = y.replace(' ', '_');`).",
