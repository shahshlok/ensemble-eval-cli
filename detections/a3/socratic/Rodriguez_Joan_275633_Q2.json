It does not implement any part of the required number guessing game: there is no random number between 1 and 100, no guessing loop, no 'Too high/Too low' feedback, and no termination on a correct guess. This is a complete divergence from the specified algorithm, so all rubric criteria for Q2 are unmet.",
