          "conceptual_gap": "The student has confused the loop boundary with the actual shifting requirement. When shifting right by one position, element at index `i` should move to index `i+1`. The loop should iterate from index `N-2` down to `0` (not from `N-2` to `0`), but more importantly, the student hasn't recognized that `b = N-2` creates an off-by-one error. The loop `for (int i = b; i >= c; i--)` with `b = N-2` and `c = 0` will execute for indices `N-2, N-3, ..., 1, 0`, which is correct. However, the variable names suggest the student is thinking of `b` and `c` as loop boundaries rather than understanding them as index values. The real issue is that this approach happens to work by accident, but reveals confused thinking about what these variables represent.",

The student has added unnecessary complexity by introducing `b = N-2` and `c = 0` before the loop.
