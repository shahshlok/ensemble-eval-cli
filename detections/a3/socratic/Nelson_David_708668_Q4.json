          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, an assignment like `arr[i] = arr[i - 1];` directly copies the value from the source location to the destination location. The intermediate `temp` variable is unnecessary for the logical operation, as `arr[i-1]` is stable during that assignment statement. This overcomplicates the simple concept of sequential memory assignment.",

The check `if (n < 0) { n = 0; }` suggests they think this is possible to recover from, when in fact Scanner won't return a negative integer for this use case (the user must type a number), and even if it did, the defensive check wouldn't solve a real problem.",

The pattern `int temp = arr[i - 1]; arr[i] = temp;` is redundant\u2014they could simply write `arr[i] = arr[i - 1];` directly.
