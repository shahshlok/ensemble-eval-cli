          "task": "Reading numeric grade input",
          "name": "Implemented an entirely different program (distance formula) instead of grade calculator",
          "description": "STEP 1 (What correct code should do): Read a single numeric grade between 0 and 100 (typically as int or double) from the user, then use an if/else-if/else chain to test which range it falls into: 90\u2013100 \u2192 'A', 80\u201389 \u2192 'B', 70\u201379 \u2192 'C', 60\u201369 \u2192 'D', below 60 \u2192 'F'. Finally, print the corresponding letter grade in the format 'Letter grade: X'.\nSTEP 2 (Trace of student's code): The program is named DistanceBetweenPoints. It creates a Scanner, then prompts 'Enter x1 and y1: ' and reads two doubles x1 and y1. Then it prompts 'Enter x2 and y2: ' and reads two doubles x2 and y2. It computes distance = sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2) using Math.sqrt and prints 'The distance of the two points is ' followed by the numeric distance. There are no conditionals and no letter-grade output.\nSTEP 3 (Divergences): 1) Input: Instead of reading a single numeric grade, the program reads four doubles representing two coordinate pairs. 2) Core logic: Instead of branching on grade ranges with if/else-if to determine a letter, the program computes a geometric distance using the distance formula. 3) Output: Instead of printing 'Letter grade: <A/B/C/D/F>', it prints a descriptive sentence about distance with a numeric result. 4) There is no use of any of the grade ranges (90\u2013100, 80\u201389, etc.) and no handling of 'F' as a default/else case.\nSTEP 4 (Diagnosis of WHY): This is best seen as a procedural/conceptual mismatch: the student appears to have written or reused a solution to a different textbook problem (distance between two points) rather than the requested grade-calculator problem. There is no evidence here of specific misconceptions about variables, data types, or reading input\u2014the Scanner usage is fine\u2014but there is a missing understanding/attention to translating the problem statement into the correct control-flow structure (if/else-if range checks and mapping to letters). The student likely believes that submitting any correctly compiling program from their work set is acceptable for this question, or they misread/ignored the specific requirements.\nSTEP 5 (Score against rubric): Because the program does not implement a grade calculator at all: \u2022 Reading numeric grade input (1/1): 0/1 \u2013 Reads four coordinates instead of one grade. \u2022 Correct Boolean ranges for A and B (1/1): 0/1 \u2013 No conditions on grade values. \u2022 Correct Boolean ranges for C and D (1/1): 0/1 \u2013 Also missing. \u2022 Correct handling of F (default/else) (1/1): 0/1 \u2013 No default/else case. \u2022 Mapping each range to correct letter output (1/1): 0/1 \u2013 Outputs distance instead of a letter. Total = 0/5.\nSTEP 6 (Summary): The submission is a correct distance-between-points calculator but does not attempt the required grade-calculator problem, so it earns 0/5 on this rubric. Conceptually, the main issue is with problem interpretation and mapping requirements to code, not with Java syntax or basic I/O. For future work, the student should slow down when reading the problem, list the required inputs, decisions (ranges), and outputs, and then write code that mirrors that structure, especially using if/else-if/else for range-based classifications.",
