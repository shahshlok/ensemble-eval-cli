Although both result in the same visual appearance on a console, printing the string literal guarantees string type output. If the problem setter intended for the output to be a machine-parsable integer in all cases (including the -1 sentinel), the student's choice to print the specific string literal `\"-1\"` instead of the integer value `-1` is a subtle misunderstanding of required output types.",

Since the requirement is only to print the index or -1, the student implements a necessary format change for the success case, but redundantly prints the literal string `\"-1\"` instead of just using the variable `k` in the failure case, suggesting a separation of concerns about output formatting based on the success condition.",
