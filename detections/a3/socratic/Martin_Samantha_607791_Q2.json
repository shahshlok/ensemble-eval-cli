          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that related attributes (like a student's name and score) must be stored in entirely separate, independently managed primitive arrays, where the linkage is strictly enforced by ensuring identical numerical indices correspond to the same student. They view data coherence as a manual synchronization task across multiple memory locations.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The code demonstrates a successful, yet fragile, manual implementation of data linkage required by parallel arrays. The conceptual gap is that the student models related data as needing explicit, index-based synchronization rather than seeing the opportunity for encapsulation. A robust Java model would involve combining the name and score into a single object (e.g., a `Student` class) and using an array of these objects. This automatically maintains data integrity during sorting or manipulation, whereas the parallel array approach requires replication of swap logic (lines 33-35) every time the score array is mutated.",
