          "name": "Implemented road trip cost calculator instead of number guessing game",
          "description": "STEP 1: What correct code should do\nA correct solution should:\n- Create a Random object and generate a secret integer between 1 and 100 using nextInt(100) + 1.\n- Use a loop (while or do-while) that repeatedly:\n  - Prompts the user: \"Guess a number (1-100): \"\n  - Reads an integer guess from the user.\n  - Compares the guess to the secret number.\n  - If the guess is too high, prints \"Too high!\".\n  - If the guess is too low, prints \"Too low!\".\n  - If the guess is correct, exits the loop and prints a message like \"Correct! You took X guesses.\", where X is the number of attempts.\nKey implementation details:\n- Correct use of java.util.Random.\n- A counter variable to track how many guesses have been made.\n- A loop that terminates only when the guess equals the secret number.\n- if/else logic to decide between \"Too high\", \"Too low\", and \"Correct\".\n\nSTEP 2: Trace the student's code\nLine by line, the student's program does the following:\n- Imports java.util.Scanner.\n- Declares a public class RoadTripCostQ2.\n- In main, creates a Scanner named input for reading from System.in.\n- Prompts: \"Enter the driving distance in miles: \" and reads a double distance.\n- Prompts: \"Enter miles per gallon: \" and reads a double mpg.\n- Prompts: \"Enter price in $ per gallon: \" and reads a double pricePerGallon.\n- Computes cost = (distance / mpg) * pricePerGallon.\n- Prints \"The cost of driving is $\" followed by the computed cost.\n- Closes the Scanner and terminates.\nThere is no use of Random, no guessing loop, no comparison of guesses to a secret number, and no \"Too high\"/\"Too low\" messages.\n\nSTEP 3: Identify divergences\n1) Wrong problem implemented\n- Specific code: The entire main method is focused on reading distance, mpg, and price, and computing a trip cost:\n  - Prompts for distance, mpg, and price per gallon.\n  - Computes (distance / mpg) * pricePerGallon.\n  - Prints the cost.\n- What it does: Solves a \u201croad trip cost\u201d calculation problem.\n- What it should do: Implement a number guessing game with a randomly generated secret number between 1 and 100, repeated guesses, and feedback on each guess.\n\n2) Missing random number generation\n- Specific code: There is no Random object or call to nextInt.\n- What it does: No secret number is ever generated; the concept of a hidden answer does not exist in this program.\n- What it should do: Use Random rand = new Random(); int answer = rand.nextInt(100) + 1; to generate the secret number.\n\n3) Missing guessing loop\n- Specific code: The program reads three values once (distance, mpg, pricePerGallon) and then ends; there is no while or do-while loop.\n- What it does: One-shot input then immediate termination.\n- What it should do: Use a loop that continues prompting the user for guesses until the correct number is guessed.\n\n4) Missing \"Too high\" / \"Too low\" logic\n- Specific code: The only output message after inputs is \"The cost of driving is $\" + cost.\n- What it does: Reports a single numeric result; no conditional feedback.\n- What it should do: After each incorrect guess, compare guess and answer and print \"Too high!\" or \"Too low!\" accordingly, and only print a \"Correct!\" message once the guess matches the secret number.\n\n5) Missing specific termination condition based on correct guess\n- Specific code: Program terminates after computing and printing cost, regardless of user input.\n- What it does: End of program is unrelated to any notion of a correct guess.\n- What it should do: Terminate the guessing loop only when guess == answer and then report the number of guesses taken.\n\nSTEP 4: Diagnose the WHY\nThis appears to be primarily a conceptual/procedural issue related to solving the wrong problem, rather than misunderstanding Java syntax or basic types.\n- Likely student belief: The student seems to believe that Q2 required a road-trip cost calculator (or they accidentally submitted the wrong file/solution), so they implemented the formula-based calculation instead of the guessing game.\n- Correct understanding: For this question, the required behavior is an interactive guessing game driven by randomness, loops, and conditionals, not a numeric formula calculation.\nCategory (schema topic): Other (this is about problem interpretation and control-flow design, not about variables, data types, constants, or basic input reading).\n\nSTEP 5: Score against rubric\n- Generating random number (1-100) [1 mark]\n  - Score: 0/1\n  - Justification: No Random object, no call to nextInt(100) + 1; there is no secret number.\n\n- Loop for guessing (while/do-while) [1 mark]\n  - Score: 0/1\n  - Justification: No loop that allows multiple guesses; the program just reads input once and exits.\n\n- Logic for \"Too high\" hint [1 mark]\n  - Score: 0/1\n  - Justification: No comparison between a guess and a secret number, and no \"Too high!\" output.\n\n- Logic for \"Too low\" hint [1 mark]\n  - Score: 0/1\n  - Justification: Same as above; no conditional feedback about guesses.\n\n- Specific termination condition (correct guess) [1 mark]\n  - Score: 0/1\n  - Justification: Program termination is unrelated to guessing; it ends after printing cost instead of when the user guesses the secret number.\n\nSTEP 6: Summary\n- Total score: 0/5 based on the provided rubric, because none of the required game mechanics (random number, guessing loop, high/low feedback, or termination on correct guess) are present.\n- Key misconception: The main issue is implementing an entirely different problem (road trip cost) instead of the specified number guessing game. There is no evidence here of misunderstandings about variables, data types, or basic input; rather, the student either misread the assignment or submitted the wrong solution.\n- Overall feedback: Re-read the problem statement carefully and ensure that your code behavior matches the described sample run. For this question, you must (1) generate a random secret number between 1 and 100, (2) repeatedly prompt the user for guesses in a loop, (3) print \"Too high\" or \"Too low\" after incorrect guesses, and (4) stop only when the user guesses correctly and then report how many guesses it took.",
