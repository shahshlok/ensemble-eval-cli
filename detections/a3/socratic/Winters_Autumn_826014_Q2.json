It never generates a random number, never asks the user to guess, and does not use a loop or conditional hints (\"Too high\" / \"Too low\").

          "correct_understanding": "For this question, the program must implement a number guessing game: generate a random secret number between 1 and 100, repeatedly prompt the user for guesses in a loop, give feedback after each wrong guess (\"Too high\" or \"Too low\"), and terminate only when the correct number is guessed, reporting how many guesses were taken.",
