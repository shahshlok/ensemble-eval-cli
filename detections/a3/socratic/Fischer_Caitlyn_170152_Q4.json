          "student_thought_process": "The student may have previously believed (or attempted) that array elements could be uniformly shifted right using a standard forward loop iteration (e.g., `for(i=0; i<n-1; i++){ x[i+1] = x[i]; }`) without understanding that this sequential update corrupts the subsequent read operations within the same loop structure.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The actual Java execution model processes array assignments sequentially. In a forward shift loop, setting `x[i+1] = x[i]` means that in the next iteration, the value read from `x[i+1]` is the new, duplicated value, resulting in the entire array being filled with the original `x[0]` value. The student correctly uses backward iteration (Lines 11) to avoid this state corruption dependency, demonstrating that they are aware of, or have been taught the solution to, this subtle sequential dependency issue, which is a common initial misconception for array manipulation.",
          "error_manifestation": "The student's final code is correct, but the logic structure implies an awareness of the pitfalls of incorrect state propagation typically associated with forward shifting loops.",
