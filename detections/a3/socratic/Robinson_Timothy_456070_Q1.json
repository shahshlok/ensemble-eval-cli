          "conceptual_gap": "The operational requirement is to print 'Found at index: X' if found, or '-1' if not found. The student's code prints 'Found at index: X' if found (Lines 35-36) but only '-1' if not found (Line 38). While the requirement states 'If T is not found, print -1', the sample output implies a specific format, and the student's final `else` block is slightly different from the sample run's implicit expectation for a failure case (though the requirement text supports the student's implementation for the failure case). A deeper flaw is in the conditional logic structure itself.",

However, looking closely at the requirement ('Print the index of the first occurrence... If T is not found, print -1.'), the student's implementation exactly matches the requirement for the negative case (printing only -1). The sample run provided only shows the success case. They have one format for success and a different format for failure.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The output logic correctly implements the literal instructions of the problem description: print the index prepended by text, or print -1. However, common novice errors often involve mixing text with the required numerical output (e.g., printing 'Not found: -1'). The student avoided that specific error in the else block, implementing the logic correctly according to the strict text. The flaw, if any, is extremely tiny.",

          "conceptual_gap": "The assignment required printing the index *or* -1. The sample output shows: 'Found at index: 1' (success) and the implied output for failure is just '-1'. The student correctly initializes `found_index` to -1 and uses a search loop with `break`. However, the final `if/else` block introduces proprietary descriptive text ('Found at index: ') only in the success branch, and just prints the numeric value in the failure branch. A more robust solution would be to unify the output, perhaps always printing the final value of `found_index` after the loop, or ensuring the output matches provided samples exactly for both success and failure states.",
