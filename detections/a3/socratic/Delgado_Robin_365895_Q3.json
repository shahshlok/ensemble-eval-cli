          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that converting a string to uppercase (using `toUpperCase()`) and replacing characters (using `replace()`) are separate, necessary steps, even though the variable tracking the original modified string (`modifiedUserInputText`) could have been used for both operations, or the operations could have been chained. The student successfully uses the return value of the string methods, demonstrating an understanding that `String` methods do not modify the string in place. However, the redundant creation of `uppercaseUserInputText` and the sequential assignment shows a step-by-step, non-chaining approach, indicating a potential struggle with intermediate variable management during sequential transformations.",
          "conceptual_gap": "While the code is functionally correct and respects Java's String immutability model (by assigning the returned, new string to a new variable), the student creates an unnecessary intermediate variable (`uppercaseUserInputText`). The conceptual gap is not in immutability itself, but rather in efficient variable management and understanding that method calls can be chained (`userInputText.toUpperCase().replace(\" \", \"_\")`) or that the variable holding the result can be reused via reassignment, indicating a very literal, linear-step mental model where each transformation requires a unique named placeholder.",
