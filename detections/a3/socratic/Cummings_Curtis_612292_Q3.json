However, the pattern suggests they may not fully grasp WHY this is necessary. They appear to treat each method call as producing a 'new version' they must explicitly store, rather than understanding that strings cannot be modified at all. The misconception is subtle: they're doing the right thing for the wrong reason\u2014they may believe that if they didn't create variable c, the replace() operation would fail or be lost, rather than understanding that b.replace() returns a new string that must be captured.",

However, the misconception becomes evident if the student were asked 'What would happen if you didn't assign the result of replace() to c?'

          "conceptual_gap": "The student successfully implemented the solution by creating intermediate strings (`b` and `c`) to hold the results of transformations (`toUpperCase()` and `replace()`). While this code is functionally correct for the goal, the explicit creation of two intermediate variables to perform two non-modifying operations suggests they might not fully grasp that the operations *must* be chained or the results stored/reassigned because the methods do not alter the string they are called upon. The key gap is not a functional error here, but a potentially inefficient mental model regarding why separate variables for chained operations are generated by the system, rather than just choosing to store the result of the final operation.",
