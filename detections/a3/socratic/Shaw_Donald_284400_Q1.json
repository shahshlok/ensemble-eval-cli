For instance, they initialize `c` to -1 and `a` to 0, only to reassign them based on the current index `i` or array value `arr_numbers[i]` within the first iteration.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The Java execution model requires variables only when they are needed to hold state or simplify calculation. Defining and initializing variables like `a`, `b`, and `c` (especially `b` which is unused, and `a` and `c` which are immediately reassigned inside the loop without relying on their initial values) suggests a misunderstanding of state persistence and variable necessity in iterative algorithms. In Java, intermediate variables should be scoped and defined where truly needed, or directly use the necessary expressions (e.g., `if (arr_numbers[i] == T)` instead of assigning to `a` first).",
