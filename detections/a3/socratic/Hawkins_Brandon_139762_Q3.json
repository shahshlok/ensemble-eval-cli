          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, Strings are immutable. Every String method that appears to 'modify' the string actually returns a NEW String object. The original string is never changed. The student's code correctly captures the return values into new variables (upperCaseText and modifiedText), which suggests they may have learned this rule, but the conceptual understanding of WHY this matters and how it differs from mutable objects (like arrays or custom objects) may not be internalized.",
