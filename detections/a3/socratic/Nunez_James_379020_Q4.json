          "conceptual_gap": "In Java (and most imperative languages), variable assignments execute sequentially. The statement `int temp = numbers[i - 1];` reads the value from `numbers[i - 1]`. The *next* statement, `numbers[i] = temp;`, assigns that read value directly to `numbers[i]`. Since `numbers[i - 1]` is not modified before its value is used in the assignment to `numbers[i]`, the intermediate `temp` variable is redundant. The assignment could simply be `numbers[i] = numbers[i - 1];`. The use of `temp` suggests a potential over-cautiousness or a misunderstanding of how sequential assignment affects subsequent array accesses, perhaps fearing that the value at `numbers[i - 1]` might somehow be overwritten before `numbers[i]` is updated, even though `numbers[i - 1]` is never updated within this specific loop iteration.",
