          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that printing 'Found at index: ' is mandatory only when they successfully find the index (`y != -1`). However, when `y == -1`, they believe they must print *only* the value -1, without any accompanying context or prompt, even though the problem implies a full solution output or a specific error message structure.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The conceptual gap is subtle but relates to following instructions precisely regarding output format. While the logic determines the existence of `y` correctly, the output formatting diverges based on the condition. The student should either ensure both positive and negative results match a consistent output style (like 'Found at index: X' or '-1'), or, specifically, adhere strictly to the target output specification. The student's code produces `Found at index: 1` correctly, but if the target is 99, it outputs `-1`, whereas a more consistent approach following the successful output format might be expected, or at least a negative index message (though the prompt only asks to print -1). The most direct evidence of the flaw is that the required sample output includes the phrase 'Found at index:', but when the result is -1, the code only outputs '-1'. This shows inconsistent handling of output based on success/failure state.",
