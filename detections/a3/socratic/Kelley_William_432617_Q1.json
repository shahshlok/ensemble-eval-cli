          "conceptual_gap": "The student's logic is sound and correctly implements the required behavior. The loop iterates, sets 'index' to the current index 'i' upon the *first* match, and immediately terminates using 'break'. If no match is found, 'index' remains at its initialized value of -1. This is a common and correct pattern for finding the first occurrence. No misconception is present regarding initialization or control flow.",
