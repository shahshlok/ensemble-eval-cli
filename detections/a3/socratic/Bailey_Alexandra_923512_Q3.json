          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that methods like `toUpperCase()` and `replace()` on a String object might change the object in place, or perhaps they over-learned the concept of String immutability and now explicitly separate the steps into temporary variables to capture the return value, even when chaining might be more idiomatic. Given the note provided in the problem description, the student is being extremely cautious to ensure they capture the new String object created by the method call.",
          "conceptual_gap": "While the student correctly captures the return values of `toUpperCase()` (Line 14) and `replace()` (Line 17), demonstrating an understanding that the original string (`userInputLine` or `uppercaseUserInputLine`) is not modified, they slightly misunderstand the purpose of string immutability in relation to method chaining. String methods that transform strings (like `toUpperCase()` and `replace()`) are designed to return a new object precisely because the original is immutable. If the student fully trusted the mechanism, they might chain the calls together (`userInputLine.toUpperCase().replace(\" \", \"_\")`), which is a more advanced, but standard, pattern.",
