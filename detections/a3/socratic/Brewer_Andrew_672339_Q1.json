The student clearly knows how to:\n  - Use Scanner\n  - Read from the keyboard\n  - Perform arithmetic\n  - Print a formatted message\n  but they are applying those skills to the wrong problem.\n- This is best classified as a procedural error (wrong algorithm / wrong task) and likely a careless or organizational mistake (using the wrong file or example) rather than a deep conceptual misunderstanding of variables, data types, or input.\n\nSTEP 5: Scoring against the rubric\n1) Reading 5 integers from input (1.0 point)\n   - The code reads 3 doubles (v0, v1, t) instead of 5 integers.\n   - No attempt to read exactly 5 values; types and prompt do not match the problem.\n   - Score: 0 / 1.0\n\n2) Loop structure to process inputs (1.0 point)\n   - No loop is used; only three direct nextDouble() calls.\n   - The program never iterates over 5 inputs.\n   - Score: 0 / 1.0\n\n3) Conditional check for even numbers (n % 2 == 0) (1.0 point)\n   - There is no conditional and no use of the modulus operator.\n   - No logic exists to distinguish even and odd numbers.\n   - Score: 0 / 1.0\n\n4) Accumulating sum and printing result (1.0 point)\n   - The program computes a single expression (v1 - v0) / t into acceleration and prints it with an unrelated message.\n   - There is no accumulator for a sum, no count of even numbers, and the printed message is about average acceleration.\n   - Score: 0 / 1.0\n\nTotal: 0 / 4.0\n\nSTEP 6: Summary\n- The submission solves a different physics problem and does not attempt the required task of summing even numbers from 5 integers.\n- As a result, none of the rubric criteria are met, and the effective score is 0/4.\n- Key issue is not misunderstanding Java basics, but failing to implement (or submit) a solution to the specified problem.
