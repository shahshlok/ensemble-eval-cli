          "description": "STEP 1: Expected behavior\nThe correct solution should:\n- Create a Random object and generate a secret integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive).\n- Repeatedly prompt the user to \"Guess a number (1-100):\".\n- Read each guess from the keyboard.\n- After each incorrect guess, print either \"Too high!\" if the guess > secret number, or \"Too low!\" if the guess < secret number.\n- Count the number of guesses.\n- Stop when the user guesses correctly, then print something like \"Correct! You took X guesses.\"\n\nSTEP 2: What the student's code does\nLine by line, the student's program:\n- Imports java.util.Scanner.\n- Declares a public class RoadTripCostCalculator with main.\n- Creates a Scanner userInputScanner for System.in.\n- Prompts: \"Enter the driving distance in miles: \" and reads a double drivingDistanceMiles.\n- Prompts: \"Enter miles per gallon: \" and reads a double milesPerGallon.\n- Prompts: \"Enter price in $ per gallon: \" and reads a double pricePerGallon.\n- Computes costOfDriving = (drivingDistanceMiles / milesPerGallon) * pricePerGallon.\n- Prints \"The cost of driving is $\" + costOfDriving.\n- Closes the scanner and terminates.\n\nSTEP 3: Divergences\nThe entire structure of the program diverges from the required number guessing game:\n- Class name and purpose: RoadTripCostCalculator instead of a guessing game.\n- No Random object and no generation of a number between 1 and 100.\n- No loop to allow multiple guesses.\n- No conditional logic for \"Too high\" or \"Too low\" based on a secret number.\n- No termination condition based on a correct guess; the program simply performs a one-time cost calculation and exits.\n\nWhat the code does vs. what it should do:\n- Instead of implementing a game loop with random target and repeated guesses, it implements a single-pass numeric computation for trip cost.\n\nSTEP 4: Diagnosis (WHY)\nThis is not a small typo or off-by-one issue; it appears the student has submitted code for a completely different exercise (a road trip cost calculator, common in early CS1) rather than the required number guessing game.\n- Likely cause: The student either mixed up files/questions or did not read/align this code with Q2's specification.\n- This is therefore best seen as a procedural/assignment-specification issue, not a misunderstanding of variables or data types.\n\nFrom the evidence we **cannot** infer a specific misconception about Random, loops, or conditionals; they are simply absent. The dominant issue is that the required algorithm for Q2 was never attempted in this file.\n\nTopic category: Other (the issue is about matching the problem specification, not a specific concept like variables or input).\n\nSTEP 5: Rubric scoring\nGiven this submission for Q2:\n- Generating random number (1-100) [1/1]: 0 points. No Random object, no call to nextInt, no secret number between 1 and 100.\n- Loop for guessing (while/do-while) [1/1]: 0 points. No loop around user guesses.\n- Logic for \"Too high\" hint [1/1]: 0 points. No comparison of guesses to a secret number; hint never printed.\n- Logic for \"Too low\" hint [1/1]: 0 points. Same as above.\n- Specific termination condition (correct guess) [1/1]: 0 points. Program terminates after computing driving cost, not based on a correct guess.\n\nSTEP 6: Summary\n- Total score for Q2: 0 / 5.\n- Key misconception: The submitted program does not address the number guessing game at all; it solves a different problem (road trip cost calculation). There is no evidence here about the student's understanding of random numbers, loops, or conditional hints for a guessing game.\n- Overall feedback: For Q2, you need to write a separate program that implements the number guessing game as described: generate a random answer between 1 and 100, repeatedly prompt for guesses in a loop, use if/else to print \"Too high\" or \"Too low\" until the guess is correct, and count the attempts.
