Since the loop iterates backward, `arr[i-1]` contains the necessary original value, and a direct assignment (`arr[i] = arr[i-1]`) is sufficient and more efficient. The student's belief in the necessity of `temp` suggests an overly cautious or complex model of how simple assignment works within a loop structure.",

The temporary variable is unnecessary because the student isn't trying to preserve arr[i-1]; they're simply moving it rightward.

However, the overall pattern\u2014save first, process in a separate step, restore separately\u2014suggests the student may not fully appreciate that the loop iteration order (from n-1 down to 1) inherently protects arr[0] from being overwritten until the end.
