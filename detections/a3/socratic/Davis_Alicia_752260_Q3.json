          "description": "STEP 1: What correct code should do\nA correct solution should:\n- Create a Scanner to read a single numeric grade between 0 and 100 (int or double) from the user.\n- Store this grade in a variable.\n- Use an if/else-if/else chain (or equivalent logic) to map numeric ranges to letter grades:\n  - 90\u2013100 -> 'A'\n  - 80\u201389 -> 'B'\n  - 70\u201379 -> 'C'\n  - 60\u201369 -> 'D'\n  - below 60 -> 'F'\n- Print the result in the format: `Letter grade: X`, where X is the correct letter.\n\nSTEP 2: Trace of the student's code\n- The class is named `DistanceBetweenPoints`, suggesting a different problem.\n- A `Scanner` is created and the user is prompted with `Enter x1 and y1:`.\n- The program reads four `double` values: `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`.\n- It computes `dx = x2 - x1` and `dy = y2 - y1`.\n- It computes `distance = Math.sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy)`.\n- It prints `The distance of the two points is ` followed by the numeric distance.\n- It never reads a grade, never computes a letter grade, and never uses conditionals.\n\nSTEP 3: Divergences from the required solution\n1) Input mismatch\n   - Code: prompts for `x1`/`y1` and `x2`/`y2` and reads four doubles.\n   - Required: prompt for a single numeric grade (0\u2013100) and read that one value.\n\n2) Missing conditional logic for grade ranges\n   - Code: only performs arithmetic and a square root; there are no `if`, `else if`, or `else` statements.\n   - Required: a structured set of conditional checks implementing the A/B/C/D/F ranges.\n\n3) Incorrect output behavior\n   - Code: prints a sentence about \"distance of the two points\" followed by a distance.\n   - Required: print `Letter grade: <letter>` based on the grade ranges.\n\nSTEP 4: Diagnosis (WHY)\n- This appears to be a **careless / administrative mistake**, not a Java concept misunderstanding.\n- Likely causes:\n  - The student may have copied in a solution from a different assignment (distance between points problem).\n  - Or they may have submitted the wrong file / not replaced template code.\n- There is no evidence of confusion about variables, data types, constants, or input methods\u2014the code for distance is syntactically and semantically reasonable, just for the wrong problem.\n\nSTEP 5: Score against rubric\n- Reading numeric grade input (1 point): **0/1**\n  - No grade is read; instead, four coordinate values are read.\n- Correct Boolean ranges for A and B (1 point): **0/1**\n  - No conditionals at all; A/B ranges are not checked.\n- Correct Boolean ranges for C and D (1 point): **0/1**\n  - No conditionals; C/D ranges are not checked.\n- Correct handling of F (default/else) (1 point): **0/1**\n  - No default/else case; F is never produced.\n- Mapping each range to correct letter output (1 point): **0/1**\n  - No letter grades are printed; only a distance value is output.\n\nTotal: **0/5**.\n\nSTEP 6: Summary and feedback\n- The submitted program solves a different problem (distance between two points) and does not attempt the grade calculator at all.\n- To fix this, the student needs to:\n  - Remove the distance-related logic.\n  - Read a single numeric grade from the user.\n  - Use an if/else-if/else chain to test the grade against the specified ranges.\n  - Print the correct letter grade in the required format.\n- Conceptually, there is no clear misunderstanding of Java basics here; the main issue is addressing the wrong task. In future, the student should double-check that their code directly matches the problem statement and rubric before submitting.",
