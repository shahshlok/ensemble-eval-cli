          "conceptual_gap": "The student appears to understand that Strings are immutable (as evidenced by the note in the problem), but their code pattern suggests they think each method call modifies the string and requires a new variable assignment. While their code is actually CORRECT, the pattern reveals they may not fully grasp that immutability means methods return NEW strings rather than modifying existing ones. They're treating it like: 'call method A on string, get new string, then call method B on that new string' - which is correct behavior, but suggests they might think the methods are 'doing something' to the original rather than creating new objects.",
          "error_manifestation": "No error - the code works correctly. However, this reveals a potential misconception about WHY the code works. If asked 'what happens to the string `upper` after you call replace on it?', the student might reveal confused thinking about object identity vs. value.",

          "conceptual_gap": "While method chaining is not essential for correctness, the student's approach of creating intermediate variables (upper and result) suggests they may not understand that methods can be called sequentially on return values in a chain. This isn't a misconception that causes errors, but it reveals the student is thinking of method calls as separate operations that must be stored, rather than understanding that methods return objects that can immediately have other methods called on them.",
