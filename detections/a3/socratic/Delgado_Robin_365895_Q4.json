          "conceptual_gap": "The student's model involves unnecessary verbosity. Java provides dedicated, concise, and idiomatic decrement operators (`i--`) which are specifically designed for counting down indices and are simpler to read and often more efficient than defining an external step variable and applying it using `+= step`. Using three separate variables to control a simple reverse loop structure suggests the student views index manipulation purely as generic arithmetic requiring explicit setup for all three components (start, end condition, delta), rather than utilizing the standard optimized constructs of the language.",
