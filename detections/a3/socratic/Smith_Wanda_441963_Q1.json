The student should:\n  * Carefully re-read the question to ensure they understand the required behavior.\n  * Rewrite main so it reads 5 integers, uses a loop and an accumulator, checks n % 2 == 0, and prints \"Sum of even numbers: <sum>\".\n  * Verify that the prompt, variable names, and printed message match the actual assignment, not a previous or different problem.",
