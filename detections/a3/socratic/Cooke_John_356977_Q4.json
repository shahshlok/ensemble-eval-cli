This likely stems from an overgeneralization of the three-step swap pattern, fearing that reading and writing the value directly (`numbers[i] = numbers[i-1]`) might somehow lead to corrupted data or immediate modification of `numbers[i-1]` before the assignment completes, even though indices `i` and `i-1` are distinct locations.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java (and most imperative languages), the assignment operator (`=`) evaluates the right-hand side completely before performing the assignment to the left-hand side. Copying one variable/index content to another does not require a temporary variable unless the value being read is about to be immediately overwritten (which is not the case for `numbers[i-1]` in a backward shift). The use of `temp` (lines 23-24) introduces unnecessary indirection and complexity.",

This leads to redundant variable declarations.",
