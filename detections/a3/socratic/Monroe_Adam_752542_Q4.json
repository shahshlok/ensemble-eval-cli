This suggests a mental model that favors highly explicit intermediate storage, perhaps stemming from a misunderstanding of how Java evaluates expressions on the right-hand side of an assignment operator.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, array element assignment is value-based, and the right-hand side of an assignment (`userInputArray[shiftIndex - 1]`) is fully evaluated before its value is copied to the left-hand side (`userInputArray[shiftIndex]`). The introduction of the temporary variable `elementToShift` is unnecessary complexity. Direct assignment (`userInputArray[shiftIndex] = userInputArray[shiftIndex - 1];`) would achieve the exact same, guaranteed-safe result.",

They may believe the algorithm could 'break' on edge cases without explicit protection, rather than understanding that their while loops already handle edge cases correctly (a while loop with 'shiftIndex > 0' naturally doesn't execute if the condition is false from the start).
