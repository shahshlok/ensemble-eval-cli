          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, an array element access expression like `arr[i]` evaluates directly to the element's value (an r-value) and can be used immediately in any expression where a simple variable is expected, such as `if (arr[i] == t)`. The intermediate assignment to the variable `a` is redundant and adds unnecessary steps to the execution trace, even though it doesn't cause functional failure. The student's mental model suggests a need for an extra layer of dereferencing or stabilization before the value is safe for comparison.",
