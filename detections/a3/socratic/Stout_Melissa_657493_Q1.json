          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that printing the '-1' (for 'not found') case must be handled outside the main search loop, and that combining the successful 'found' message with the 'not found' message in a final conditional block (if/else) is the standard structure for this type of problem, even though the `break` statement already ensures the index found is the *first* correct one.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student successfully implemented the core search logic using `break` to guarantee the *first* index is saved (or remains -1). However, the output structure following the loop (printing the index directly if found, or '-1' if not) is redundant or overly complex for the requirement. A more robust mental model would recognize that since the loop correctly utilizes `index = -1` as a sentinel/default value, and `break` prevents updating subsequent indices, the final `if/else` block is correctly structured to manage both outputs based on the final value of `index`. Since the logic is technically correct and achieves the desired output, this is not a major misconception leading to failure, but rather a perfect execution of the required conceptual steps.",
