If they started from index 0, they would overwrite `y[1]` with `y[0]` before `y[0]` had a chance to move to `y[1]`, resulting in a duplication of the first element.",

By saving `y[n-1]` in `t` (line 18), the value is preserved when `y[n-1]` is overwritten by `y[n-2]` during the backward traversal loop. Without this step, the wrap-around functionality would fail.",
