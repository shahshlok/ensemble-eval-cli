They include the assignment `y = ...` to 'save' the output, which correctly directs the variable `y` to the new string object, but this correct operational step may mask a deeper confusion about the immutable nature of String objects.",
          "conceptual_gap": "Java String objects are immutable. Methods such as `toUpperCase()` do not modify the object they are called on; they **always** return a completely new String object. The assignment operator (`y = ...`) is therefore not redundant\u2014it is mandatory to update the reference held by the `y` variable from the old string object to the newly created one. A student fully grasping immutability understands this assignment updates the variable reference, not the content of the original string memory block.",
