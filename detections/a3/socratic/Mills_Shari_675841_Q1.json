          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that when reading a sequence of N inputs for an array (e.g., lines 21-23), the `Scanner` object processes input specifically tied to that loop and will automatically separate those N inputs from the later single input read for the target number (line 28), regardless of how the user types the input.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The `Scanner` object reads tokens from a single, continuous input stream (in this case, `System.in`). It does not inherently know that the N array elements and the 1 target element should be provided on different lines or separated by a specific pattern. If the user enters all elements and the target on a single line (e.g., `10 20 30 20 50 20`), the `for` loop (lines 21-23) will consume the first N tokens (`10 20 30 20 50`), and then the final `keyboardScanner.nextInt()` (line 28) will immediately consume the very next available token (`20` in the example) without waiting for a new line or prompt, which can lead to confusion about program flow and input prompts.",
          "error_manifestation": "None in the provided sample run, but this mental model is fragile. If the user enters input on a single line, the program might appear to skip the prompt for the target number, making the program seem faster or incorrect than expected, though the logic for finding the index is sound.",
