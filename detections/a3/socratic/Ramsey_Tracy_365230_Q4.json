The student may be conflating 'explaining your thinking' (good practice) with 'the explanation helps the code work correctly.' Comments are ignored by the Java compiler. If the logic is flawed, comments cannot fix it. Additionally, the student seems to believe that verbose commenting is necessary to prove competence, when in fact clear, concise code with minimal comments is often a sign of mastery.",
