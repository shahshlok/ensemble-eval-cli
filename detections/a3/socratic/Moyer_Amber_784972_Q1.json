          "conceptual_gap": "The student appears to conflate code documentation practices with code functionality. Comments are ignored by the Java compiler and have zero impact on program execution. The student may think that explaining their logic in comments somehow helps Java understand or execute the code better, or that comments are a requirement for correctness rather than a best practice for readability.",

          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that using highly descriptive, full-length variable names (like `userNumberArray`, `userInputScanner`, `firstOccurrenceIndex`) makes the code more correct or helps Java understand the intent better.",
          "conceptual_gap": "While descriptive naming is a good practice for readability, the student may not fully understand that Java treats `userNumberArray`, `arr`, and `x` identically from an execution standpoint. Variable names are purely symbolic identifiers; they have no impact on program correctness or logic. The excessive verbosity suggests the student believes longer names somehow make the code 'safer' or more 'correct' rather than simply more readable.",
          "error_manifestation": "No runtime error, but reveals uncertainty about the distinction between code clarity (a human concern) and code correctness (a machine concern). This suggests the student may not fully grasp that the Java runtime cares only about the structure and logic, not the aesthetic choices in naming.",
