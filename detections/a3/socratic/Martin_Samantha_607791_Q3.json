Methods like `.toUpperCase()` and `.replace()` do not modify the original string; instead, they return a NEW string with the transformation applied. The student appears to understand this conceptually (as evidenced by the note in the problem), but their code structure suggests they may not fully internalize that they MUST capture the return value in a new variable to use the result. The code is actually correct, but this reveals the student may have been confused initially or is following instructions without full understanding.",
          "error_manifestation": "No runtime error in this case (code is correct), but the pattern suggests the student may have initially believed the methods modify in-place and only through external correction or trial-and-error learned to assign the return values to new variables.",
