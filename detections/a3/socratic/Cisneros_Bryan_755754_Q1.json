They think the computer doesn't distinguish between meaningful and non-meaningful identifiers.",
          "conceptual_gap": "While Java syntax allows single-letter variable names, this reflects a misconception about code clarity and maintainability rather than a functional error. The student may not understand that variable names are semantic choices made for human readers, not just arbitrary tokens. The deeper gap is that the student hasn't internalized that programming is communication\u2014names should reflect intent and purpose.",

The misconception is subtle: they may think that initializing to -1 'pre-emptively' is required, rather than understanding that -1 is a sentinel value returned when the loop completes without finding a match. This indicates incomplete mastery of loop logic and control flow.",
