While functionally correct, the brevity and sequencing suggest the student may not fully appreciate that the `break` statement immediately and irrevocably terminates the entire `for` loop. They might harbor a lingering doubt that the loop continues iterating or that `break` only exits the `if` block.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The Java `break` statement is designed to immediately terminate the innermost enclosing loop or switch statement. Understanding this instantaneous, mandatory termination is crucial for both correctness (guaranteeing the *first* index) and efficiency (avoiding unnecessary iterations). If the student misunderstood its mechanism, they might rely on this pattern without fully grasping why it works or how it affects runtime efficiency.",

          "conceptual_gap": "The code structure separates the output path into two distinct blocks: one specifically for the 'not found' case (printing just '-1') and another for the 'found' case (printing 'Found at index: ' + z). While functionally correct for the problem constraints, a more common and robust approach would be to assign the desired final 'result' string (either the index or '-1') to a variable immediately before the output phase, or to reorganize the logic to eliminate the redundant final checks based on the problem's output requirements. The specific output structure demanded by the problem sample run forces this separation, but the student's implementation suggests handling the success and failure messages as completely separate concerns rather than integrated logic where the result variable `z` holds the answer regardless of the output formatting needed.",
          "error_manifestation": "The code is functionally correct and produces the expected output. The misconception relates to stylistic or structural redundancy rather than execution failure, specifically regarding how final output logic is structured.",
