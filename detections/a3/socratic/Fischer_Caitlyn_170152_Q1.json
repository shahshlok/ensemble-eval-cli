          "conceptual_gap": "While the student correctly uses `break` (line 12) to exit the loop immediately upon finding the first occurrence, the overall program structure is slightly redundant regarding the final output handling. The student initializes `y = -1` (line 11) for the 'not found' case and only updates it if found. However, there is a common beginner pattern where students struggle to combine the loop exit and the final conditional check robustly. Although this code is functionally correct due to the robust use of `y=-1` initialization, the execution path implies a check for `y == -1` (line 13) even when a match is found, which is unnecessary if the output were handled immediately inside the loop. The approach here is overly structured for a simple task, suggesting potential structural confusion, though it works perfectly. A more subtle, non-fatal misconception detected is relying on the final if/else structure (lines 13-14) to print results based on `y`'s value, which is generally good practice but might mask a desire to simplify the logic (e.g., just printing `y` directly and relying on the `y=-1` initialization, which the student does, but adds the extra text 'Found at index: ' if positive).",
