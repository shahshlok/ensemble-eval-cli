          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that method calls on String objects must be stored in intermediate variables (like `upperLine`), even when the desired operations could be chained directly onto the result of the preceding operation, or applied sequentially to the same variable name (due to the creation of a new string object each time). This suggests a strong adherence to strictly procedural steps rather than utilizing the functional return value pattern common in immutable data structures like Java Strings.",
          "conceptual_gap": "Java Strings are immutable. Every modifying method call (`toUpperCase()`, `replace()`, etc.) returns a new String object. The student correctly captures these intermediate results (`upperLine`, `result`). However, the unnecessary introduction of `upperLine` suggests a reluctance or lack of knowledge regarding method chaining (i.e., `String result = inputLine.toUpperCase().replace(\" \", \"_\");`) or a formal understanding that the return value of `toUpperCase()` is itself a String object suitable for calling `.replace()` immediately. The code is logically correct but demonstrates an overly verbose procedural style often adopted when immuatbility mechanics are not fully utilized.",

They seem to feel compelled to explicitly name and store intermediate components of the final output string.",
          "conceptual_gap": "While defining `outputPrefix` and `outputLine` is syntactically valid, it adds unnecessary variables. The Java execution model allows for direct concatenation within the `System.out.println` call, treating the expression result as the argument to the method. The student's approach suggests a rigid, multi-step construction process where `outputPrefix` and `result` are separate entities that must be formally joined and stored before the print function can accept them.",
