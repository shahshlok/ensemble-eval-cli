          "name": "Solved the wrong problem (distance between points instead of grade calculator)",
          "description": "The program entirely implements a different task than the specified grade calculator. Instead of reading a single numeric grade (0-100) and mapping it to a letter grade A\u2013F using conditional ranges, the code reads four doubles (x1, y1, x2, y2), computes the Euclidean distance between two points, and prints that distance. As a result:\n\nSTEP 1 (Expected): The correct algorithm should:\n- Prompt for a numeric grade: e.g., \"Enter grade: \"\n- Read one number (0\u2013100) from the keyboard.\n- Use if/else-if/else conditions to check ranges: 90\u2013100 => 'A', 80\u201389 => 'B', 70\u201379 => 'C', 60\u201369 => 'D', below 60 => 'F'.\n- Print \"Letter grade: <letter>\".\n\nSTEP 2 (Actual Trace): The student code:\n- Prompts: \"Enter x1 and y1: \" and \"Enter x2 and y2: \".\n- Reads four double values (x1, y1, x2, y2).\n- Computes dx = x2 - x1, dy = y2 - y1.\n- Computes distance = Math.sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy).\n- Prints: \"The distance of the two points is \" + distance.\n- It never reads a grade, never checks any ranges, and never outputs a letter grade.\n\nSTEP 3 (Divergences):\n- Input divergence: Code reads four doubles for coordinates, not one numeric grade.\n- Logic divergence: Code computes a geometric distance, not grade ranges.\n- Conditional divergence: No if/else structure at all; no Boolean ranges for A, B, C, D, or default F.\n- Output divergence: Output is a distance message, not \"Letter grade: X\".\n\nSTEP 4 (Diagnosis): This appears to be a conceptual/procedural error: the student has implemented a completely different exercise (a standard \"distance between two points\" problem). They likely either copied another solution or confused assignments. There is no evidence of misconceptions about variables, data types, or Scanner specifically; rather, the problem is not being addressed.\n- Student seems to believe: implementing any correct Java program (here, a distance calculator) is sufficient, or they misread the question and thought they were asked to compute distance between points.\n- Correct understanding: The code must implement exactly the specified behavior (grade to letter-grade mapping), including correct input, conditions, and output format.\n\nSTEP 5 (Score against rubric): Because the program does not attempt the grade-calculator task, all rubric items receive 0.\n- Reading numeric grade input (1/1): 0/1. The program reads coordinates (x1, y1, x2, y2) instead of a single numeric grade.\n- Correct Boolean ranges for A and B (1/1): 0/1. No conditional logic or ranges for 90\u2013100 (A) or 80\u201389 (B).\n- Correct Boolean ranges for C and D (1/1): 0/1. No ranges for 70\u201379 (C) or 60\u201369 (D).\n- Correct handling of F (default/else) (1/1): 0/1. No else/default case; in fact, no conditionals related to grades at all.\n- Mapping each range to correct letter output (1/1): 0/1. The program never outputs any letter grade.\n\nSTEP 6 (Summary):\n- Total score: 0/5 based on the provided rubric.\n- Key misconception: The entire problem specification is not followed; the student solved a different problem.\n- Overall feedback: You are writing valid Java code that uses Scanner and arithmetic correctly, but it does not answer the question that was asked. You need to write a program that reads ONE numeric grade and uses if/else conditions to decide which letter grade to print.\n",
