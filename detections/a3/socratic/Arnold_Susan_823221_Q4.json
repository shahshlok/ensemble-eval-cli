          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that adding extensive comments, descriptive variable names, and detailed explanations of each step will somehow make the code more correct or demonstrate deeper understanding of the algorithm.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student conflates code clarity and documentation with algorithmic correctness. In Java, the computer executes the actual logic regardless of how well-commented or verbose the code is. Comments are purely for human readers and have zero impact on program behavior. The student appears to think that demonstrating their thinking process through comments is necessary for the solution to work, when in fact the only thing that matters is the executable statements themselves.",
          "error_manifestation": "No runtime error or wrong output, but the code structure suggests the student doesn't fully trust their own logic and feels compelled to 'explain' each step as if reassuring themselves or a reviewer. This indicates uncertainty about whether the logic itself is sound.",

          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that using overly descriptive variable names like `userInputScanner`, `userInputArray`, `lastElementValue`, and `currentIndex` is necessary and improves code correctness, rather than being a stylistic choice that doesn't affect program execution.",
          "conceptual_gap": "While good naming is a best practice for readability, the student seems to be conflating naming convention with logical correctness. The student may believe that the verbosity of variable names somehow helps the computer understand intent better, when variable names are purely symbolic identifiers. This suggests the student hasn't fully internalized that Java treats `s` and `userInputScanner` identically in terms of execution\u2014only humans perceive the difference.",
