This suggests a mental model that treats array access as a complex, unstable, or computationally costly operation that must be 'cached' even when only used once immediately.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, accessing `arr[i]` for a primitive type directly yields the value and should be used immediately in expressions like `if (arr[i] == t)`. The intermediate step of creating the variable `a` is completely superfluous, demonstrating a slightly inefficient or overly cautious representation of how the machine retrieves and uses primitive values from memory.",
