          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that a `while (i > 0)` loop is the correct construct to iterate through an array from the second-to-last element down to the first element (index 0) while accessing the element one position before the current index (`i-1`).",
          "conceptual_gap": "When shifting elements to the right, the loop needs to ensure the element at index 1 receives the value from index 0. The current loop (`while (i > 0)`) stops when `i` becomes 1. At this point, the code executes `numbers[1] = numbers[0];`, correctly copying the value. However, the iteration structure is often confusing for beginners. Iterating from `n-1` down to `1` is correct for the shift, but the use of `i > 0` might imply a misunderstanding of which indices are actually processed (i.e., they might think `i` must be greater than zero, forgetting that `numbers[0]` is handled separately and the loop is responsible for indices `n-1` down to `1`). While the logic is *correct* for a right shift where the last element is saved/handled separately, the common beginner error is stopping too early or too late; here, the structure is technically correct but reflects a common area of confusion when boundary conditions are involved, specifically using `i > 0` vs `i >= 1` and ensuring index 1 is the last loop body execution.",
