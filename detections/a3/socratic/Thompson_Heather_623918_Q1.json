Furthermore, the repeated assignment 'a = i;' inside the loop suggests a belief that array access must happen via a dedicated variable ('a'), rather than directly using the loop counter ('i').",

The variable 'b' is completely irrelevant to the successful linear search implementation and should be removed. The variable 'a' is initialized redundantly and then used as a substitute for the loop counter 'i', adding an unnecessary layer of indirection and assignment overhead. The loop counter 'i' is the appropriate and sufficient index for array access in this context.",
