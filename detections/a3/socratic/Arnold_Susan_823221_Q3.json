While this is correct behaviorally, the use of three separate variables indicates a potential underlying assumption that the original variable's immutability must be preserved via a new assignment on *every* step, rather than understanding that method chaining or reusing the input variable name is permissible if desired, showing strict adherence to the note ('Strings are immutable') rather than functional understanding.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student correctly understands that String methods return a new string (immutability), but unnecessarily avoids method chaining (`originalUserInputLine.toUpperCase().replace(' ', '_')`) or variable reuse, which suggests a rigid, perhaps superficial, interpretation of immutability as always requiring a brand new variable name for every modification step, rather than just ensuring the original object remains unchanged.",
