The student's program instead prompts for \"v0, v1, and t\", reads three values as Strings, parses them as doubles, computes a = (v1 - v0) / t, and prints \"The average acceleration is ...\". There is no loop, no even-number test, no accumulation of even values, and no final sum printed. A stray attempt to read another value and add it to a sum appears at the end, but it is not integrated into any correct algorithm for the given problem.",
