          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that when shifting all elements of an array to the right, they can iterate through the array indices from right-to-left (n-1 down to 1), assigning `x[i] = x[i-1]` without losing any data, treating the array indices as independent variables that are processed sequentially.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student correctly realizes that a right shift requires working backward to avoid overwriting elements before they are used. However, their loop starts the shift at `i = n-1` and stops at `i > 0` (i.e., `i=1`). This successfully shifts elements from index `n-2` to `n-1`, `n-3` to `n-2`, ..., down to index `0` to `1`. The number that *should* be shifted into `x[0]` is correctly saved in variable `a`. Crucially, the loop condition `i > 0` means the element at `x[0]` is never shifted anywhere *by the loop*\u2014it is correctly copied into `x[1]` when `i=1`. The conceptual gap is minor: they performed a correct right shift of all elements from index 0 to n-2, and then correctly handled the wrap-around assignment to `x[0]`. The code is logically correct based on the sequential execution model, which shows the student has a strong understanding of how to prevent data loss during an array shift. No major misconception found regarding the shift logic itself.",
