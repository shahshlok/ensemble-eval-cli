          "name": "Solved a completely different problem (distance formula instead of grade calculator)",
          "description": "STEP 1: Expected behavior/algorithm\nA correct solution should:\n- Prompt the user for a single numeric grade between 0 and 100 (e.g., \"Enter grade: \").\n- Read that single numeric input (usually into an int or double variable called grade).\n- Use an if/else-if/else chain (or equivalent) to test the grade against the given ranges:\n  - If grade is between 90 and 100 (inclusive), choose letter 'A'.\n  - Else if between 80 and 89, choose 'B'.\n  - Else if between 70 and 79, choose 'C'.\n  - Else if between 60 and 69, choose 'D'.\n  - Else (below 60), choose 'F'.\n- Print the result in the format: \"Letter grade: X\" where X is A/B/C/D/F.\n\nSTEP 2: What the student's code actually does\nLine by line:\n- Imports java.util.* and defines class Main and main method correctly.\n- Creates a Scanner s to read from System.in.\n- Prints \"Enter x1 and y1: \" and then reads two doubles x1 and y1 using nextDouble().\n- Prints \"Enter x2 and y2: \" and then reads two more doubles x2 and y2.\n- Computes d = Math.sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2), which is the distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2).\n- Prints \"The distance of the two points is \" followed by d.\n- The program then ends.\n\nSTEP 3: Divergences from the required solution\n1) Input shape and meaning\n   - Code: prompts for \"Enter x1 and y1:\" then \"Enter x2 and y2:\" and reads four doubles (x1, y1, x2, y2).\n   - Actual behavior: treats the task as computing distance between two points.\n   - Required behavior: prompt for \"Enter grade:\" and read a single numeric grade value.\n\n2) Missing grade-based conditional logic\n   - Code: there are no if/else conditions based on a grade; there is only a distance formula.\n   - Actual behavior: computes a mathematical distance regardless of what the assignment asked.\n   - Required behavior: use conditional logic to check numeric ranges for A/B/C/D/F and select the correct letter.\n\n3) Incorrect output and format\n   - Code: prints \"The distance of the two points is \" followed by a numeric distance.\n   - Actual behavior: never prints any letter grade or a message like \"Letter grade: B\".\n   - Required behavior: print a letter grade label exactly as specified.\n\nSTEP 4: Diagnosis (WHY)\n- Nature of error: This is not a small typo or local bug; the entire program solves a different problem. This points to a procedural/conceptual issue: the student either reused code from a different exercise (distance between two points) or misread the problem and implemented the wrong algorithm.\n- Student seems to believe: \"For this question, I should read two 2D points and compute the distance between them using the distance formula.\"\n- Correct understanding: \"For this question, I should read a single numeric grade between 0 and 100, then use conditional statements to map that numeric grade to a letter grade (A/B/C/D/F) and print the letter.\"\n- Topic category (from the provided list): Other (the main issue is problem interpretation/algorithm choice, not specifically variables, data types, constants, or keyboard input mechanics).\n\nSTEP 5: Scoring against rubric\nGiven the rubric categories, the submission does not meet any of the grading criteria for this problem:\n1) Reading numeric grade input (1.0 point)\n   - The program does read input, but not the required input (a single numeric grade). It instead reads four doubles for coordinates.\n   - Score: 0 / 1.0\n\n2) Correct Boolean ranges for A and B (1.0 point)\n   - No grade variable, no Boolean expressions checking 90\u2013100 or 80\u201389.\n   - Score: 0 / 1.0\n\n3) Correct Boolean ranges for C and D (1.0 point)\n   - No logic for 70\u201379 or 60\u201369.\n   - Score: 0 / 1.0\n\n4) Correct handling of F (default/else) (1.0 point)\n   - No conditional structure at all, so there is no default/else case for grades below 60.\n   - Score: 0 / 1.0\n\n5) Mapping each range to correct letter output (1.0 point)\n   - The output is a distance description, not any letter grade. No mapping from numeric range to A/B/C/D/F occurs.\n   - Score: 0 / 1.0\n\nTotal score: 0 / 5.0.\n\nSTEP 6: Summary and feedback\n- Total score: 0 / 5 because the program does not attempt the required grade-mapping task.\n- Key misconception: The student implemented a different problem (distance between two points) instead of a grade calculator. There is no evidence of understanding grade ranges or conditional mapping in this submission.\n- Overall feedback: For future problems, carefully re-read the prompt and make sure the inputs, variable names, and printed messages all line up with what is being asked. For this question, start from a fresh main method that:\n  1) Prompts for and reads a single numeric grade.\n  2) Uses an if/else-if/else chain to test the grade against the ranges 90\u2013100, 80\u201389, 70\u201379, 60\u201369, and below 60.\n  3) Prints the correct letter grade in the specified format (\"Letter grade: X\").\nOnce you do that, you can reuse the Scanner and printing skills you already demonstrated here, but applied to the correct problem.",
