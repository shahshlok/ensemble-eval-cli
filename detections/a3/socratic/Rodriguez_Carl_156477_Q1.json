The student did not parse the instruction 'Print the index' literally, instead deciding to replicate the formatting seen in the Sample Run output, including the phrase 'Found at index: '.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student conflates conversational print statements (which are useful for human interaction) with specific data output requirements (which often demand only the exact value). The computer system, when checking output, typically expects only the specified index value itself (e.g., '1'), and extraneous text like 'Found at index: ' would fail automated tests. The student misunderstands the level of strictness required for program output based on prompt specifications.",

Furthermore, the student believes that the structure of the `if/else` block satisfies all required output conditions.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The conceptual gap lies in distinguishing between required program logic and required output format. The problem states: \"If T is not found, print -1.\" (Implied: *only* print -1). The student correctly handles the logic of determining if an element is found (`if(a==-1)`), but incorrectly chooses the output format when it is not found, prefixing the output with unnecessary text ('-1') instead of printing the required integer output.",

This suggests potential confusion between printing numerical values and printing literal strings that happen to contain those numbers, particularly in the context where the alternative output includes a descriptive string and a variable (`\"Found at index: \"+a`).",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, `System.out.println(value)` prints the representation of `value`. Printing `\"-1\"` prints the characters '-' and '1'. While this usually produces the desired visual result, framing the output as a literal string suggests the student focused on matching the visual appearance of the failed case rather than understanding that they needed to output the *value* stored in `a` (which is -1) or simply the integer -1, possibly leading to issues if parsing the output as a number was required downstream.",
