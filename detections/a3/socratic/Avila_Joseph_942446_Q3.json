          "description": "STEP 1: What correct code should do\n- Prompt: print something like \"Enter grade: \".\n- Input: read a single numeric grade (typically an int) in the range 0\u2013100 using Scanner.\n- Logic: use an if/else-if chain to test the numeric grade against the ranges:\n  - 90\u2013100 -> 'A'\n  - 80\u201389  -> 'B'\n  - 70\u201379  -> 'C'\n  - 60\u201369  -> 'D'\n  - below 60 -> 'F' (either via explicit condition or final else).\n- Output: print the corresponding letter grade, e.g., \"Letter grade: B\".\n\nSTEP 2: Trace of the student's code\n- Imports Scanner and defines class DistanceBetweenPoints.\n- In main, creates a Scanner on System.in.\n- Prompts \"Enter x1 and y1: \" and reads two doubles x1, y1.\n- Prompts \"Enter x2 and y2: \" and reads two doubles x2, y2.\n- Computes dx = x2 - x1 and dy = y2 - y1.\n- Computes distance = Math.sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy).\n- Prints \"The distance of the two points is \" followed by the numeric distance.\n- Closes the Scanner.\nThis is a correct distance-between-points program, but it does not attempt any grade calculation.\n\nSTEP 3: Divergences from the required solution\n1) No grade input\n   - Code: reads four doubles (x1, y1, x2, y2) instead of a single grade.\n   - Actual behavior: expects coordinates for two points.\n   - Required behavior: read one numeric grade (0\u2013100).\n\n2) No conditional logic for grade ranges\n   - Code: only performs arithmetic and Math.sqrt; there are no if/else-if statements.\n   - Actual behavior: always computes a distance, regardless of input.\n   - Required behavior: use conditional logic to map numeric ranges to letter grades A\u2013F.\n\n3) Wrong output domain\n   - Code: prints \"The distance of the two points is ...\" with a number.\n   - Actual behavior: outputs a distance, not any letter grade.\n   - Required behavior: output a letter grade like \"Letter grade: B\" based on the numeric input.\n\nSTEP 4: Diagnosis (WHY)\n- This is not a small typo or off-by-one issue; it is a completely different program.\n- Likely causes:\n  - The student reused code from a different exercise (distance between two points).\n  - Or they misread the problem and implemented the wrong task.\n- Conceptual issue (topic = Other):\n  - Apparent belief: \"For this question it is acceptable to submit any working Java program, even if it solves a different problem.\"\n  - Correct understanding: \"The program must implement the specified grade calculator: read a single grade, use conditionals to check ranges 90\u2013100, 80\u201389, etc., and print the correct letter grade.\"\n\nSTEP 5: Score against rubric\nGiven that the submission does not attempt a grade calculator:\n- Reading numeric grade input (1.0): 0/1\n  - No grade is read; instead, four coordinate values are read.\n- Correct Boolean ranges for A and B (1.0): 0/1\n  - No conditions or ranges implemented.\n- Correct Boolean ranges for C and D (1.0): 0/1\n  - No conditions or ranges implemented.\n- Correct handling of F (default/else) (1.0): 0/1\n  - No default/else or handling of below-60 case.\n- Mapping each range to correct letter output (1.0): 0/1\n  - No letter grades are produced; output is a numeric distance.\nTotal: 0 / 5\n\nSTEP 6: Summary\n- Total score: 0/5.\n- Key misconception: the student did not implement the specified grade calculator at all; they wrote a different program (distance between two points). There are no evident misconceptions about variables, data types, or input mechanics in this code, just a mismatch with the problem.\n- Overall feedback: Carefully re-read the problem statement before coding. For this question, you should:\n  1) Read a single numeric grade (0\u2013100).\n  2) Use an if/else-if chain to test which interval the grade falls in (90\u2013100, 80\u201389, etc.).\n  3) Print the corresponding letter grade (A\u2013F). Your current code for computing distance is fine for that separate task, but it does not address this question.",
