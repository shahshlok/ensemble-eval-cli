While their code is correct, they might not understand that the original string variable `y` is strictly *immutable* and cannot be modified in place, confusing String behavior with mutable data structures familiar from other programming contexts.",
          "conceptual_gap": "Java Strings are immutable. A call to `y.toUpperCase()` does not alter the string object that `y` references. It creates and returns a reference to a brand new String object. The student correctly captures this new reference using assignment, but the underlying flaw might be failing to distinguish between methods that mutate their object (none in Java String) and those that return a new object (all in Java String). This is directly relevant to the 'Note' provided in the problem description.",

          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, Strings are immutable. Methods like toUpperCase() and replace() do not modify the original String; instead, they return a NEW String object with the requested modifications. The student's code actually works correctly (it produces the right output), but this reveals they may not fully understand WHY it works. They're treating method calls as if they're modifying objects in-place, rather than understanding that these methods return new values that must be captured in variables.",
