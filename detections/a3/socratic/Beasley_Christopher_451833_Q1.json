However, this structure is generally considered poor style or less readable than using an explicit `break` statement inside a loop with a simpler condition (`i<n`). While functionally correct for this specific problem, it indicates a focus on jamming the 'stop' condition into the loop definition rather than separating control flow logic (finding and exiting) from iteration logic (checking the bounds). In Java, a common pattern for 'find first' is a simple `for (int i=0; i<n; i++)` loop containing an `if` check and a `break` or `return` if inside a method.
