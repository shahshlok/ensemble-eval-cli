While functional, this design risks confusion if the sentinel value were ever ambiguous or required recalculation. A robust mental model typically recognizes that control flow state (Has Found?) should be governed independently of the final output container (Index Found: Y).",

While this specific implementation works correctly for finding the *first* occurrence because `i++` is the last statement, the underlying belief that setting `y` stops the loop immediately is a risky practice that could lead to errors if cleanup or subsequent destructive operations were present after setting `y=i` but before `i++` and the loop end.",
