          "description": "The student wrote a program to compute the cost of driving given distance, miles per gallon, and fuel price, instead of implementing the specified number guessing game where the computer picks a random number between 1 and 100 and the user repeatedly guesses with 'Too high'/'Too low' feedback until correct.",

          "remediation_hint": "Re-read the problem statement carefully and design the algorithm specifically for the number guessing game: (1) create a Random object and generate an int from 1 to 100, (2) use a loop to keep asking the user for guesses, (3) compare each guess to the secret number and print 'Too high' or 'Too low' when incorrect, and (4) end the loop only when the guess is correct, tracking and printing the number of attempts.",
