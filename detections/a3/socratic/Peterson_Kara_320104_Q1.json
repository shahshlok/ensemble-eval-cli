This ensures the loop condition (`j < n`) fails on the next check, effectively stopping the iteration.",
          "conceptual_gap": "While setting the counter variable to the boundary value is functionally correct for terminating this specific while loop, Java offers the standard control flow statement `break` specifically for immediate, early termination of a loop. Using `break` is more idiomatic, readable, and separates the goal of stopping the loop (control flow) from the mechanism of iteration (index tracking). Relying on boundary manipulation demonstrates an incomplete model of available loop control features.",

          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, standard iteration involves incrementing the loop variable regardless of whether the target is found, unless an explicit control flow statement like `break` is used to exit the loop immediately. While setting the loop variable equal to the limit often works to terminate the loop (as the loop condition `j < n` will fail on the next iteration), relying on explicit manipulation of the control variable within a conditional block inside the loop body is an unorthodox and complex way to achieve an early exit. The more idiomatic and clear approach for early exit is the `break` statement. Furthermore, managing the increment inside an `else` branch prevents the counter from advancing if the target is found, which is unnecessary if using `break`, or leads to logic errors if the loop condition isn't correctly structured for termination.",
