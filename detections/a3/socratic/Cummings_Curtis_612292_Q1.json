          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that variable names are purely for human readability and that using single letters (like x, y, a, b, c) is an acceptable practice because the compiler doesn't care about names and they work the same as descriptive names.",
          "conceptual_gap": "While Java's compiler indeed ignores variable names, the student appears to underestimate how variable naming affects code maintainability and readability. More importantly, the student may not fully grasp that good naming conventions reflect understanding of what data represents. Using 'x', 'y', 'a', 'b', 'c' instead of 'args', 'scanner', 'array', 'target', 'resultIndex' suggests the student hasn't internalized that naming should communicate semantic meaning and intent to other programmers (and to their future selves).",
