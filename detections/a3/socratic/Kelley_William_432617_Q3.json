The student's code correctly implements the requirements by chaining or sequentially applying methods and storing the results in new variables ('upper', then 'result'), which is the correct pattern for handling immutable strings.",
          "conceptual_gap": "There is no conceptual gap related to immutability in the provided code. The student correctly implements the requirements of the problem using methods that return new strings, which is the correct way to handle immutable strings in Java. The only 'gap' is that a specific instructional note about immutability was included in the problem prompt, but the student's solution doesn't violate any rules of string immutability since they correctly assigned results to new variables. If this were a misconception, it would target students who tried to call `input.toUpperCase()` and expected `input` to be modified, but this student did not do that.",

          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, strings are immutable. Methods like `toUpperCase()` and `replace()` do not change the existing string object; instead, they return a *new* string object containing the modified content.

The misconception is latent, revealed by the assignment structure itself, but the student's *implementation* handled the immutability correctly by capturing the return value.
