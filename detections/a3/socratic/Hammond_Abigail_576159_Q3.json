          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, Strings are immutable. Methods like toUpperCase() and replace() do not modify the original String object; instead, they return a NEW String object with the transformation applied. The student may not realize that each method call creates a new String and must capture the return value. While the student's code is actually correct (they DO capture the return values), the fact that they're doing this suggests they might not fully understand WHY - they may think they're being cautious rather than understanding it's mandatory.",
          "error_manifestation": "No runtime error occurs because the student correctly assigns the return values to new variables. However, this suggests the student may have learned the pattern without fully internalizing the immutability concept. If they later tried to write `input_line.toUpperCase();` and then use `input_line` expecting it to be uppercase, they would encounter the misconception.",
