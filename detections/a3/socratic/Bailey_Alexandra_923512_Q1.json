          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that the primary purpose of the `break` statement (Line 37) is efficiency\u2014to stop the loop once the element is found to save computation time. They may not fully realize that `break` is absolutely necessary for the *correctness* of the 'Find the First Occurrence' requirement, as omitting it would cause `foundIndex` to be repeatedly overwritten, resulting in the index of the *last* occurrence being reported (if the target appears multiple times).",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student has a fragile understanding of how sequential assignment interacts with the loop's objective. In Java's execution model, the loop iterates until its condition is false. If multiple matches occur, the assignment statement (`foundIndex = currentIndex;`) will execute repeatedly. The student must understand that `break` is the mechanism required to interrupt this sequential process and preserve the index of the initial match.",
          "error_manifestation": "If the student removed the 'break' statement, the program would produce the index of the last occurrence instead of the required first occurrence.",
