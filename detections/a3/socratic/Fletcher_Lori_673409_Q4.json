          "conceptual_gap": "There is no conceptual gap related to array shifting logic. However, the student includes an unnecessary defensive check (`if (n > 0)`) for a correctly implemented array shift, which would automatically handle `n=0` gracefully if the rest of the loops/logic were designed slightly differently (e.g., if the loops were over a non-empty array). In this specific implementation, protecting the access of `arr[n-1]` when `n=0` is required, making the check technically correct but indicative of careful, perhaps overly cautious, programming rather than a fundamental flaw.",
