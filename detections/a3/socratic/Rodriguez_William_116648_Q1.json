Since the loop bounds (0 to N) are fixed and known, the variables `a` and `b` are superfluous. They do not alter the program's flow or efficiency, but their unnecessary introduction suggests a rigid, misunderstood template for search algorithms (perhaps derived from trying to generalize from binary search) where boundaries must always be defined externally as manipulable variables, even if they are never manipulated.",
