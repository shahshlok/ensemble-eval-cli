          "inferred_category_name": "Redundant Break Usage",
          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that even though they are only interested in the *first* occurrence, the `break;` statement is necessary to explicitly terminate the loop, but they do not fully grasp that the initialization `foundIndex = -1` and the lack of a re-assignment condition when an element is found already handles the 'first occurrence' requirement if the `break` were removed.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student correctly uses `break` to stop the search immediately upon finding the first match, which is highly efficient and precisely how Java loops are typically controlled for 'first occurrence' scenarios. However, this code is *perfectly correct* and efficient. If any misconception exists, it might be the belief that an additional mechanism (like defensive coding against later assignments) is needed, when the existing logic already guarantees the first index will be stored (because assignments only happen when the condition is met, and the loop stops immediately). However, the primary purpose of the `break` is efficiency, not correctness reinforcement, which the student seems to understand.",
          "error_manifestation": "None. The code is logically sound and achieves the desired result efficiently. This analysis focuses on the perceived *efficiency/redundancy* knowledge rather than a functional error.",

          "inferred_category_name": "Excessive Commenting/Misunderstanding of Scope",
          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that Java code fundamentally resembles a multi-step written narrative or essay, leading them to use extensive comments to label basic blocks of code (e.g., 'Step 1: Create a Scanner', 'Step 7: Loop through the array...'). This often indicates that they view the code more as a rigid sequence of actions requiring human narrative guidance than as executable instructions where flow control structures (like `for` loops and `if` statements) are self-explanatory markers.",
          "conceptual_gap": "While commenting is good practice, labeling every obvious step (e.g., input reading, loop initialization) suggests the student hasn't yet internalized that Java execution flow is defined entirely by keywords and syntax (e.g., `for`, `if`, variable declaration), not by surrounding narrative text. The high density of step comments suggests a reliance on prose to structure the program flow.",
          "error_manifestation": "None. This is style, but it reveals a notional idea about how readable or structured Java code must be.",
