          "description": "The submitted code is a road trip cost calculator that reads distance, fuel efficiency, and fuel price, then computes and prints the total cost of a trip. It does not implement any part of the specified number guessing game: there is no random number generation between 1 and 100, no guessing loop, no 'Too high'/'Too low' feedback, and no termination on a correct guess. As written, it cannot satisfy any of the rubric criteria for the number guessing game.",

          "category": "procedural",
          "student_belief": "The student appears to believe that submitting this road trip cost calculator program is acceptable for this question, or they may think this problem is about computing trip cost rather than implementing an interactive guessing game with randomness and loops.",
          "correct_understanding": "For this question, the program must be a number guessing game where the computer picks a random integer between 1 and 100 using Random/nextInt, then repeatedly prompts the user to guess until the guess equals the secret number. After each incorrect guess, the program should print either 'Too high!' or 'Too low!' depending on the comparison, and it should terminate specifically when the correct guess is entered, reporting how many guesses were taken.",

          "remediation_hint": "Re-read the problem statement and rubric carefully and design your program structure around them. Start by generating a random int between 1 and 100, then use a loop that keeps asking the user for a guess. Inside the loop, compare the guess to the secret number and print 'Too high!' or 'Too low!' until the user guesses correctly, then print the number of attempts.
