This might stem from an abundance of caution regarding simultaneous access or mutation.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java (and most imperative languages), primitive value assignment is instantaneous and sequential. When the shift is performed via `arr[i] = arr[i - 1]`, the value at `arr[i - 1]` is read immediately and assigned to `arr[i]`. Since `i` and `i - 1` are distinct indices, assigning to `arr[i]` does not affect `arr[i - 1]`. The use of the verbose two-step assignment (`int a = arr[i - 1]; arr[i] = a;`) is functionally correct but indicates a lack of trust in the direct assignment `arr[i] = arr[i - 1];` or confusion imported from knowledge of 'swapping' algorithms where a temporary variable is truly necessary.",
