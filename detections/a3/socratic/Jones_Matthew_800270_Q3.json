The student correctly performs the necessary re-assignment (`y = ...`), preventing a functional error, but it is uncertain whether they grasp that this assignment is necessary *because* the original object remains untouched, as opposed to thinking the method modifies the string and then returns a pointer to the modified version (which would be correct for mutable types).",
