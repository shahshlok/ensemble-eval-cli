          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that if a method call on a String variable (like `toUpperCase()` or `replace()`) results in a new variable being created and assigned (`upperCaseText` and `replacedText`), it successfully achieves the goal of modifying the string, implicitly sidestepping the immutability concept, or perhaps viewing the creation of a new variable as a slight technicality rather than a fundamental property.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student successfully writes code that achieves the desired transformation by assigning the result of non-mutating methods to new variables. While the code is technically correct, the explicit note in the prompt ('In Java, Strings are immutable') suggests the instructor intended to test the student's understanding of this concept. The student's code does not provide evidence of misunderstanding immutability, but rather, successfully handles it by creating new strings. If they had attempted `userInputText.toUpperCase();` without assignment, a clear misconception of mutation would have been present. Since the code is correct, we infer that the student either understands immutability or correctly inferred the need for assignment purely through functional observation, rather than deep conceptual understanding.",
