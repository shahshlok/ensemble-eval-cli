          "conceptual_gap": "The student has correctly implemented the core search logic but reveals a minor inconsistency in output handling. When the target IS found, they print a descriptive message: 'Found at index: 1'. However, when NOT found, they simply print '-1' with no context. This suggests the student may not fully appreciate that user-facing output should be consistent and clear, or they may not have considered that the problem statement says 'print -1' but didn't explicitly specify the format should differ from the success case.",

They seem to have interpreted the requirement to 'Print the index... If T is not found, print -1' as two separate, mutually exclusive output requirements, rather than generalizing the format when the target is not found.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The assignment specifies printing 'the index of the first occurrence of T...' and 'If T is not found, print -1.' The sample run shows 'Found at index: 1'. The student correctly identifies the need for conditional output. However, their conditional check (L28-L32) results in two different output *styles* (one with a prefix string, one without) instead of consistently printing the desired result index (which is -1 if not found, or the actual index if found). Although the current code works for the requirement, it reflects a rigid adherence to the sample output format ('Found at index: X') and a separate requirement for the failure case ('-1') which leads to unnecessary branching logic. The most direct fulfillments would be to calculate the index (which is -1 if not found) and print the index, or to match both success and failure cases to the provided success format.",
