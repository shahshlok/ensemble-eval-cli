Although `System.out.println(\"-1\")` achieves the correct output appearance, printing a literal string is fundamentally different from printing an integer variable known to hold -1 or printing the numeric constant -1. The use of double quotes suggests a focus on printing glyphs rather than the value itself, although in this specific case, the behavior is harmlessly identical to printing `y` when `y` is -1.",
