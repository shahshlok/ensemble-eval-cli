          "student_thought_process": "The student demonstrates an understanding that array element assignment is an immediate, in-place memory overwrite. They correctly inferred that a simple forward loop would cause data loss by duplicating values across the array (e.g., [1, 2, 3, 4] becoming [1, 1, 1, 1]). Therefore, they believe they must meticulously control the sequence of assignments by explicitly storing the wraparound element first and iterating backward to ensure the source element (arr[i-1]) is read before the destination (arr[i]) is overwritten.",
          "conceptual_gap": "There is no functional gap demonstrated, as the student successfully adhered to the strict sequential execution model of Java to solve the problem. However, the required complexity of the solution (saving the last element and iterating backward) reflects the common beginner struggle with visualizing and managing data dependencies during sequential destructive updates. A beginner often assumes a higher-level 'shift' operation rather than a series of sequential copy commands, a confusion the student successfully avoided by applying these control measures.",
