The student is likely thinking in terms of a conceptual ladder of ranges but did not realize that, without `else`, Java does not stop after the first true condition. They also rely solely on lower-bound checks, which creates overlapping ranges when not combined with `else if`.",
          "remediation_hint": "Change the grade classification logic to a proper `if`-`else if`-`else` ladder in descending order. For example:\n\n```java\nif (grade >= 90) {\n    System.out.println(\"Letter grade: A\");\n} else if (grade >= 80) {\n    System.out.println(\"Letter grade: B\");\n} else if (grade >= 70) {\n    System.out.println(\"Letter grade: C\");\n} else if (grade >= 60) {\n    System.out.println(\"Letter grade: D\");\n} else {\n    System.out.println(\"Letter grade: F\");\n}\n```\nThis ensures only one branch runs.
