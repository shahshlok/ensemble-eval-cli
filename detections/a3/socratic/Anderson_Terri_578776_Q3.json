          "name": "Implemented a different problem (distance formula) instead of grade calculator",
          "description": "The submitted program does not implement the required grade calculator at all. Instead of reading a single numeric grade (0-100) and mapping it to a letter grade A\u2013F using conditional ranges, it reads four doubles (x1, y1, x2, y2), computes the Euclidean distance between two points, and prints that distance. As a result, none of the rubric tasks are satisfied: it does not prompt for or read a grade, uses no Boolean range checks for A/B/C/D, has no default/else for F, and does not output any letter grade.\n\nSTEP 1 (Expected behavior):\n- Prompt: \"Enter grade: \"\n- Read one numeric input (int or double) in the 0\u2013100 range.\n- Use if/else-if/else to test:\n  - 90\u2013100 -> print \"Letter grade: A\"\n  - 80\u201389  -> print \"Letter grade: B\"\n  - 70\u201379  -> print \"Letter grade: C\"\n  - 60\u201369  -> print \"Letter grade: D\"\n  - else (below 60) -> print \"Letter grade: F\".\n\nSTEP 2 (What the code actually does):\n- Imports Scanner and creates a DistanceBetweenPoints class with main.\n- Prompts: \"Enter x1 and y1: \" then reads two doubles x1, y1.\n- Prompts: \"Enter x2 and y2: \" then reads two doubles x2, y2.\n- Computes distance = sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2).\n- Prints: \"The distance of the two points is \" + distance.\n- Closes the scanner.\n\nSTEP 3 (Divergences):\n- Input: Should read one numeric grade; instead reads four coordinate values.\n- Logic: Should use conditional ranges to map numeric grade to letter; instead uses the distance formula (no conditionals at all).\n- Output: Should print a letter grade (A/B/C/D/F); instead prints a numeric distance with a different message.\n\nSTEP 4 (Diagnosis):\n- This appears more like a careless or administrative error (submitting the wrong file or solving a different earlier exercise) than a misunderstanding of variables, data types, constants, or input.\n- There is no evidence of conceptual confusion about Java basics in this file; the Scanner usage and arithmetic are correct, but they solve the wrong problem.\n- Topic category is therefore \"Other\" rather than one of the listed specific topics.\n\nSTEP 5 (Rubric impact):\n- Reading numeric grade input: 0/1 \u2014 no grade is read; program reads coordinates instead.\n- Correct Boolean ranges for A and B: 0/1 \u2014 no conditionals or ranges for A/B are present.\n- Correct Boolean ranges for C and D: 0/1 \u2014 no conditionals or ranges for C/D are present.\n- Correct handling of F (default/else): 0/1 \u2014 no default/else and no F case.\n- Mapping each range to correct letter output: 0/1 \u2014 no letter grade is ever printed.\n\nSTEP 6 (Summary & feedback):\n- Total score: 0/5 based on the rubric, because the solution does not address the grade-calculator specification.\n- Key issue: The program solves a completely different problem (distance between points) rather than the grade mapping task.\n- Feedback: Re-read the problem statement carefully and ensure that the code you submit matches the required behavior. For this question, write a fresh program that reads a numeric grade, uses if/else-if/else to check which interval it falls into (90\u2013100, 80\u201389, etc.), and prints the corresponding letter grade.
