They correctly identify the need to save the last element (`arr[n - 1]`) beforehand to place it in `arr[0]`, indicating a sound high-level plan for the wrapping shift.",

It successfully saves the wrap-around element, shifts the body of the array, and inserts the wrap-around element at the start. Since the code correctly solves the problem as stated, no notional machine misconception is present.",

The student is doing extra work to manage spaces by using an `if (i < n - 1)` condition inside the loop. A slightly simpler, more conceptually clean approach would be to print the element, then print the space *before* the next element (or print all elements followed by a space, and then handle the trailing space removal, or use utility methods like `Arrays.toString()` if allowed). However, the implementation provided is correct behaviorally, merely verbose.",
