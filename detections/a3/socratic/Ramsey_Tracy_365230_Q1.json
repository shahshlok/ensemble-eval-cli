          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, standard practice dictates that resources like `Scanner` objects (especially those wrapping `System.in`) should ideally remain open if the program might need future input, or, if closed, it must be understood that closing a `Scanner` linked to `System.in` closes the underlying stream, which can prevent future input streams (in subsequent parts of the application or larger framework) from reading from standard input. While closing streams is good practice, closing `System.in` is often avoided in simple console applications unless termination is imminent.",
