They seem to use `break` correctly, implying they understand the stopping need, but beginners often fail to use it, believing the loop structure itself implies stopping upon the first true condition.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The conceptual gap is subtle here because the student *did* include `break;` (L27) and initialized `index_found = -1;` (L21), making the resulting code functionally correct for the requirement of finding the *first* occurrence. However, if the `break` statement were omitted, the variable `index_found` would be continuously overwritten until the last element of the array, or the last occurrence of the target `T`, was reached. The presence of L27 shows the student overcame this common beginner trap, but the design pattern itself (iterating fully and updating the index on every match) is often a source of error when the required output is the *first* match.",
