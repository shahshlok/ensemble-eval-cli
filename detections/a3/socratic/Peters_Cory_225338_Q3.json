Instead of reading a single numeric grade (0\u2013100) and mapping it to a letter grade, it reads four doubles (x1, y1, x2, y2) and computes the distance between two points. As a result, none of the rubric requirements (grade input, conditional ranges, or letter output) are met.\n\nSTEP 1 (expected): The correct solution should:\n- Prompt once for a numeric grade (0\u2013100).\n- Read that single value from the keyboard.\n- Use an if/else-if chain to test ranges: 90\u2013100 \u2192 'A', 80\u201389 \u2192 'B', 70\u201379 \u2192 'C', 60\u201369 \u2192 'D', else \u2192 'F'.\n- Print: \"Letter grade: X\" where X is the correct letter.\n\nSTEP 2 (actual trace): This program:\n- Prompts for \"Enter x1 and y1\" and reads two doubles.\n- Prompts for \"Enter x2 and y2\" and reads two more doubles.\n- Computes sqrt((x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2).\n- Prints \"The distance of the two points is ...\" with a numeric result.\n\nSTEP 3 (divergence summary):\n- Input: Reads four coordinates instead of one grade in [0, 100].\n- Processing: Computes geometric distance instead of determining a letter grade via conditionals.\n- Output: Prints a numeric distance with a mismatched message instead of \"Letter grade: <A\u2013F>\".\n\nSTEP 4 (why): This looks less like a small slip and more like the student using the wrong code file or solving a completely different problem. It is a procedural/conceptual mismatch with the assignment requirements, not a syntax issue.\n\nSTEP 5 (rubric scoring encoded here): Because the program solves the wrong problem, each rubric item would receive 0/1:\n- Reading numeric grade input: 0/1 (no grade read, wrong prompt and number of inputs).\n- Correct Boolean ranges for A and B: 0/1 (no conditions at all).\n- Correct Boolean ranges for C and D: 0/1 (no conditions at all).\n- Correct handling of F: 0/1 (no else/default case).\n- Mapping each range to correct letter output: 0/1 (prints a distance, not a letter).\nTotal: 0/5.\n\nSTEP 6 (summary/feedback): The code compiles and correctly computes distance between two points, but it does not address the grade-calculator problem. To receive credit, the student needs to write a new program that matches the specification: read one grade, use if/else-if on ranges 90\u2013100, 80\u201389, 70\u201379, 60\u201369, and else, then print the corresponding letter grade.",
