          "description": "STEP 1: Expected behavior\nA correct solution should:\n- Prompt the user (optionally) to enter 5 integers.\n- Use a loop (for or while) that runs exactly 5 times.\n- On each iteration, read one integer from the keyboard.\n- Check if the integer is even using a conditional, e.g., `if (n % 2 == 0)`.\n- If even, add it to an accumulator variable (e.g., `sum += n`).\n- After the loop finishes, print the total sum of the even numbers in the required format.\n\nSTEP 2: What the student's code does\n- Imports `java.util.*` and defines `public class Main` with `main`.\n- Creates a `Scanner s` to read from standard input.\n- Prints the prompt: `Enter v0, v1, and t: `.\n- Reads three `double` values: `v0`, `v1`, and `t` using `nextDouble()`.\n- Computes `(v1 - v0) / t` and prints: `The average acceleration is <value>`.\n\nSTEP 3: Divergences from the required solution\n1) **Input format and count**\n   - Code: `System.out.print(\"Enter v0, v1, and t: \"); double v0 = s.nextDouble(), v1 = s.nextDouble(), t = s.nextDouble();`\n   - Actual behavior: Reads exactly three `double` values labeled as initial velocity, final velocity, and time.\n   - Required behavior: Read **five integers** from the user, typically using a loop to systematically process them.\n\n2) **Lack of loop structure**\n   - Code: Inputs are read once each; there is **no loop**.\n   - Actual behavior: Handles a fixed set of three values only.\n   - Required behavior: Use a loop (for/while) to handle five inputs in a scalable way.\n\n3) **No conditional check for even numbers**\n   - Code: There is no `if` statement or `%` operator at all.\n   - Actual behavior: The program never checks whether a value is even.\n   - Required behavior: For each of the 5 integers, check `if (n % 2 == 0)` and only then add it to the sum.\n\n4) **Wrong computation and output**\n   - Code: `System.out.println(\"The average acceleration is \" + ((v1 - v0) / t));`\n   - Actual behavior: Computes a physics formula (average acceleration) and prints a corresponding message.\n   - Required behavior: Compute the **sum of even numbers** and print something like `Sum of even numbers: 14`.\n\nSTEP 4: Diagnosis (WHY)\n- This is not a small typo or a missing line; the entire program targets a **different problem** (average acceleration) than the one assigned (sum of even numbers).\n- This points to a **conceptual/procedural error about following the specification**: the student either copied the wrong template or did not connect the problem statement to the required code structure (loop, conditional, accumulator).\n- Student seems to believe: \"For this task, I should write a program that takes v0, v1, and t and computes average acceleration.\" This is unrelated to the given problem.\n- Correct understanding: \"For this task, I must write a program that reads 5 integers, uses a loop to process them, uses a conditional to select the even ones, accumulates their sum, and prints that sum.\"\n- Topic category: Other (the core issue is misunderstanding or ignoring the problem requirements, not a specific issue with variables, data types, constants, or keyboard input mechanisms themselves).\n\nSTEP 5: Score against rubric\n- Reading 5 integers from input (1.0 point)\n  - The program reads **three doubles** instead of **five integers**, and the prompt does not match the requirement.\n  - Score: **0 / 1.0**.\n\n- Loop structure to process inputs (1.0 point)\n  - There is **no loop** at all; each value is read once manually.\n  - Score: **0 / 1.0**.\n\n- Conditional check for even numbers (n % 2 == 0) (1.0 point)\n  - No conditionals or `%` operator; evenness is never checked.\n  - Score: **0 / 1.0**.\n\n- Accumulating sum and printing result (1.0 point)\n  - No accumulator for even numbers; the code computes `(v1 - v0) / t` and prints a different message.\n  - Score: **0 / 1.0**.\n\nTotal score: **0 / 4.0**.\n\nSTEP 6: Summary\n- Key issue: The submitted program solves a different problem (average acceleration) and does not attempt to sum even numbers from 5 integers.\n- Because of this, the solution earns 0/4 based on the rubric; none of the required structures (reading 5 ints, loop, even-check conditional, sum accumulator) are present.\n- Feedback: Carefully re-read the problem statement and design your program directly from it. Identify the data you must read (5 integers), the repeated pattern (process each of the 5 values \u2192 use a loop), the selection criteria (even numbers \u2192 use `if (n % 2 == 0)`), and the quantity you must compute (sum \u2192 use an accumulator variable initialized to 0).
