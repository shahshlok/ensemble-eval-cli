Methods like .toUpperCase() and .replace() do not modify the original string; instead, they return a NEW string with the transformation applied.

However, the student's mental model is fragile: if they later tried to write code that doesn't capture the return value (e.g., 'a.toUpperCase();' without assignment), they would be confused why 'a' didn't change.",

This isn't necessarily wrong, but it hints that the student may not fully grasp how method return values work\u2014they may think of intermediate variables as 'checkpoints' rather than understanding that methods simply return objects that can be used immediately.",

However, the reference variable, *a*, is mutable and can be pointed to a new String object.
