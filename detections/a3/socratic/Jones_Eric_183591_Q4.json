          "conceptual_gap": "The student misses the opportunity to use tighter, localized scoping mechanisms provided by Java, such as initializing the index inside a `for` loop header (e.g., `for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)`). Tighter scoping limits the variable's lifetime and prevents accidental state contamination between unrelated control flow blocks, leading to more robust and readable code. The current reliance on manual reinitialization (`i=0;` on multiple lines) is susceptible to error if the reset is forgotten.",
