          "conceptual_gap": "The student's logic is actually correct for finding the *first* occurrence. When `arr[i] == t` evaluates to true, `index = i` is executed, and `break` immediately terminates the loop. Since the loop iterates from `i=0` upwards, the first match found is indeed the first occurrence. There is no conceptual gap related to incorrect execution flow or variable handling for this specific logic, meaning the implementation correctly reflects a functional mental model for this task.",
