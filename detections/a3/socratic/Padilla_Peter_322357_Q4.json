          "conceptual_gap": "The student correctly implemented the standard logic for array shifting right by 1 (store last element, shift backwards, insert stored element at index 0). This implementation guarantees correctness and efficiency (O(N) time complexity). The explicit `if (n > 0)` check is redundant in terms of safeguarding the logic, as the `for` loop condition `i > 0` and the array index access `n-1` inherently handle the case where `n` might result in an array access error if `n=0`. However, accessing `arr[n-1]` when `n=0` does correctly trigger an IndexOutOfBoundsException if Java allowed zero-sized arrays to be created (which it does not, but `nextInt()` ensures `n` is non-negative.) In production code, while technically innocuous here given the context, such a check often suggests a latent fear of boundary conditions that aren't actually dangerous in this specific implementation.",
