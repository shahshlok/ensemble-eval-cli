          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that the standard array shifting loop `arr_numbers[i] = arr_numbers[i - 1]` is sufficient for all array sizes, including N=1, and correctly handles the wrap-around logic within the conditional block `if (N > 0)`. The student correctly identifies the two necessary steps: saving the last element and shifting the rest, followed by inserting the saved element at the beginning.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The code correctly implements the logic for an array right shift, including saving the last element (`N-1`) and wrapping it to the first element (`0`). The `if (N > 0)` check ensures the code doesn't execute when N=0, preventing array index errors on an empty array. The loop iterates from `N-1` down to `1`, performing the shift, and then `arr_numbers[0]` is correctly set. There is no fundamental misconception about the notional machine's operation of array bounds, indexing, or sequencing of operations. The code is logically correct based on the problem statement.",
