          "conceptual_gap": "The code correctly initializes `firstOccurrenceIndex = -1` (L51) and only updates it if a match is found (L59-L60). If the loop finishes without a match, it remains -1. The check `if (firstOccurrenceIndex != -1)` (L71) is redundant but harmless, suggesting the student might not fully trust the initialization/loop logic to guarantee the correct state, or is unnecessarily defensive.

          "conceptual_gap": "Although defensive programming is good, checking specifically for `arraySize < 0` (L15) and treating it as a 'not found' case (`-1`) is an overly specific response to invalid input. While a negative size is invalid for array allocation, the prompt implies valid execution flow starts after reading N. The robust response to invalid input is usually error handling or termination, not mimicking the 'not found' result of the search logic. Treating a negative size as an impossible search result (`-1`) indicates a loose interpretation of input validation requirements versus problem requirements.",
