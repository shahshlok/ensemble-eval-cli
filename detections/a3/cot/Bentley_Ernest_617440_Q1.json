This leads to an inconsistent output structure based on the success/failure state.",

The core instruction was to 'Print the index', suggesting a numeric output, but the student over-adhered to the sample's presentation style in the success case.",

The sample trace shows 'Found at index: 1'. The student code implements: 'Found at index: X' if found, but just '-1' if not found. While the output is technically correct, mixing formats (Line 79 vs Line 82) introduces unnecessary complexity and potential non-compliance if strict output formatting (like matching the sample exactly) was enforced, reflecting a misunderstanding of robust formatting protocols.",
