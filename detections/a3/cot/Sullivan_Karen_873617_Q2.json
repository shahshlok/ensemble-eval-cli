          "inferred_category_name": "Scanner Tokenization Misunderstanding",
          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that calling `userInputScanner.next()` three times will consume three distinct lines of input, or that the system handles array input reading automatically based on the loop structure, allowing a single line of space-separated strings to be consumed correctly by consecutive calls to `next()` within a loop, even when the input stream might have residual newline characters or complex whitespace structure due to previous `nextInt()` calls.",
          "conceptual_gap": "When reading input in Java using `Scanner`, mixing `nextInt()`/`nextLine()`/`next()` requires careful handling of whitespace and newline characters. The student correctly uses `nextInt()` (Line 10) to read the number of students. Then, when reading names (Lines 22-24), `userInputScanner.next()` typically reads tokens separated by whitespace. However, upon input processing: Input: `3 [NL] Alice Bob Charlie [NL] 85 92 78 [NL]`.\n\nLine 10 consumes `3`. The next token is `Alice`.\nLine 24 loop iteration 0 uses `next()` to consume `Alice`.\nLine 24 loop iteration 1 uses `next()` to consume `Bob`.\nLine 24 loop iteration 2 uses `next()` to consume `Charlie`.\n\nThis sequence works correctly for reading the names because `next()` bypasses leading whitespace/newlines and reads the next token (String). The student's code *does* execute correctly for the given Sample Run using `next()`, assuming the input is provided exactly as `3 [Enter] Alice Bob Charlie [Enter] 85 92 78 [Enter]`. If the student had used `nextLine()`, this would lead to the common 'skipping input' error following `nextInt()`, but since they used `next()`, which tokenizes, the input reading is technically correct and does not cause divergence *in this specific case*. The primary divergence is in the input pattern described by the prompts ('Enter names: Alice Bob Charlie') which implies a single input action generating multiple tokens, which `next()` handles by tokenization.",
