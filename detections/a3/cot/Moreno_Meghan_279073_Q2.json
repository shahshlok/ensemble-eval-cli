Crucially, they extract these values but then correctly use the array indices for the actual data modification (the swap), indicating the extracted variables are redundant.",

The creation of `left` and `right` (lines 48-49) to hold copies of `scores[j]` and `scores[j+1]` is unnecessary since the comparison `if (scores[j] > scores[j+1])` would achieve the same result without redundant variable instantiation. The student's model incorporates a superfluous staging step before comparison.",
