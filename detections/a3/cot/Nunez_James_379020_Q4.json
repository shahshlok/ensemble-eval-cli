This suggests they are over-generalizing the concept of using a temporary variable, confusing a simple transfer/copy operation with a swap operation, or holding a belief that simple array assignment might lead to data corruption if the source is not 'saved' first.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, the direct assignment `numbers[i] = numbers[i - 1]` is atomic, safe, and efficient for this operation. The source value (`numbers[i - 1]`) is evaluated completely before the destination (`numbers[i]`) is updated. The use of a temporary variable `temp` (lines 19 and 20) to momentarily hold the value of `numbers[i - 1]` and then assign it to `numbers[i]` is functionally identical but unnecessarily verbose and inefficient.",

          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that by introducing a temporary variable (`temp`) to store the value of `numbers[i-1]` *before* assigning it to `numbers[i]`, they are protecting the original value of `numbers[i-1]` for future use in the current loop iteration. They are attempting to ensure each position (`numbers[i]`) gets the value from the position to its left (`numbers[i-1]`) as it existed *prior* to the shift operation starting, or they mistake the purpose of `temp` entirely.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student misunderstands how data movement works in an iterative shift operation. When iterating backwards, `numbers[i]` should receive the original value of `numbers[i-1]`. However, since `numbers[i-1]` is updated immediately in the previous iteration (when it was `numbers[i]`), accessing `numbers[i-1]` inside the loop retrieves an already shifted value, not the original value that needs to propagate. Storing `numbers[i-1]` in `temp` *before* the assignment `numbers[i] = temp;` is redundant, as `numbers[i]` is being overwritten anyway, and `temp` simply holds the value of `numbers[i-1]` which has already been overwritten in the previous loop step. This pattern causes propagation of the second-to-last element across the entire array, instead of a clean shift. Only the first element (index 0) gets the correct final value (the original last element).",
