This reflects a misunderstanding that the algorithm can be optimized by reducing the inner loop's scope after each pass.",

Therefore, the inner comparison loop should run only up to $N - 1 - i$ indices. The student fails to include the termination condition dependent on the outer loop index, resulting in redundant comparisons and a less efficient $O(N^2)$ implementation structure.",

          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that running the inner swapping loop (which iterates over all $n-1$ adjacent pairs) $N$ times guarantees that the entire array is sorted, regardless of whether the inner loop's maximum index should decrease with each iteration of the outer loop. Specifically, the student believes that $N$ full passes over all adjacent pairs are necessary and sufficient for sorting, without realizing that Bubble Sort typically only requires $N-1$ passes, and that in each pass, the largest unsorted element settles into its final position, meaning the search space should shrink.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student's implementation of Bubble Sort fails to reduce the comparison range in the inner loop (`for(int j=0;j<n-1;j++)`) when the outer loop progresses (`for(int i=0;i<n;i++)`). More critically, the outer loop iterates $N$ times, but the inner loop compares indices up to $N-2$. The correct efficiency improvement for Bubble Sort involves shrinking the inner loop's upper bound (e.g., `j < n - 1 - i`) to skip elements already known to be in place. By keeping the inner loop static for all outer iterations, the algorithm either performs unnecessary comparisons or, in some cases like this implementation's structure, fails to achieve the expected stability/correctness for a fully optimized sort, although in this specific case, running the fixed inner loop $N$ times *does* result in a sorted array, yet it demonstrates a lack of comprehension of the sorting algorithm's core efficiency principles.",
          "error_manifestation": "The intended sorting behavior is achieved but using an inefficient and structurally incomplete knowledge of the Bubble Sort algorithm's typical structure. If $N$ were $4$, the student only needed $3$ effective passes, but performs $4$ full passes (wasting calculations).",
