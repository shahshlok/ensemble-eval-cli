This manipulation ensures the next check of the loop condition (`j < n`) fails.",
          "conceptual_gap": "Java provides specific control flow statements, such as `break`, designed for exiting a loop prematurely without requiring variable manipulation. By intertwining the search logic and the termination logic through variable arithmetic (`j=n`), the student demonstrates a reliance on variable boundaries over explicit flow control. While functional here, this pattern is brittle and obscures the developer's intent regarding iteration vs. termination.",

          "conceptual_gap": "Setting the loop counter `j = n` (line 30) does not immediately terminate the current iteration's execution block, nor does it prevent subsequent code within that iteration from running. Crucially, the student places the search logic within a `while` loop that iterates through *all* elements unless explicitly broken. When the current element at index `j` is the target, the student updates `index = j` and sets `j = n`. The loop condition `j < n` is only checked *after* the current block completes. If the target appears multiple times, the index will be correctly updated to the first, but then subsequently overwritten by the last occurrence, as setting `j=n` only causes the loop to exit on the *next* check, not immediately. This behavior differs significantly from using a `break` statement, which is the standard mechanism for premature loop termination in Java.",
