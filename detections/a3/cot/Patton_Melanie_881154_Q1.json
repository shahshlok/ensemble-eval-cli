They also seem to prefer checking equality via subtraction and zero comparison (`diff == 0`) rather than direct comparison (`x == c`).",

Original variables (N, T) and literals (0) are perfectly reliable for use in expressions and loop headers. The introduction of unnecessary variables (`a`, `b`, `c`, `x`, `diff`) increases code complexity, verbose computation (`T + 0`), and memory usage without yielding any benefit or functional change. This suggests a flawed mental model where computation requires excessive intermediate storage or that input variables should be 'protected' from direct use.",
