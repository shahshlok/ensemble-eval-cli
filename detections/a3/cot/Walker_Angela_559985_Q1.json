          "conceptual_gap": "The student correctly implements the core logic (finding the index `a`). The error lies in the output structure specified by the prompt. The prompt only requires the index `1` for the 'found' case in the sample, but implies printing *only* `-1` for the 'not found' case. The student, on L14, correctly outputs the string for the 'found' case (`Found at index: 1`) but incorrectly uses a print statement (`System.out.println(a)`) resulting in `-1` plus a newline when the sample run implies strict output conformity for the 'not found' case, potentially missing the requirement for *only* printing the raw integer `-1`. However, based strictly on the sample provided and the overall robustness, the major divergence is in handling the successful case.",
