They may mistakenly believe this algebraic method is more precise or fundamentally required, necessitating the creation of intermediate variables (a, b, c) solely for the check.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java (and most imperative languages), the standard and idiomatic way to compare two primitive numbers for equality is using the built-in relational operator `==`. The student's approach introduces unnecessary variable assignments and arithmetic operations, failing to grasp that `a == b` is an atomic logical operation provided by the language, not a derived property requiring subtraction and zero-checking. While this works for integers, it is inefficient and non-idiomatic.",
