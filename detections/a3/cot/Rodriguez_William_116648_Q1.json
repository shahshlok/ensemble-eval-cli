The student correctly uses `break;` to exit the loop immediately upon finding the first occurrence, which is the intended behavior.",

The Java execution model handles array indexing, input reading, loops, conditional assignment, and the `break` statement exactly as intended by the student. There is no conceptual gap or logical error in the standard find-first-occurrence algorithm implemented here.",
