          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, `System.out.print()` writes directly to the console stream without appending a newline. If the prompt 'Enter target: ' is immediately followed by the previous input reading (which consumed all tokens but didn't necessarily move the cursor), or if a previous print statement (like the final detected output) did not include a newline, subsequent output or prompt appearance may wrap poorly or merge with the previous line, causing visual confusion, even if the logic is correct. Specifically, missing `\n` on the final output leads to non-conforming behavior regarding standard output practices.",
          "error_manifestation": "Wrong output format/presentation (missing newline after final result). The output cursor is left immediately after the printed result, potentially causing the command prompt/shell to start on the same line.",
