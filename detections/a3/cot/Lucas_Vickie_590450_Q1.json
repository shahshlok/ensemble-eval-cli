          "conceptual_gap": "Java provides the `break` statement specifically for clean, unconditional, immediate termination of a loop. Although setting `j=n` achieves the desired functional outcome of finding the first occurrence and stopping, its usage shows a structural preference for manipulating state variables over utilizing standard control flow statements, which can lead to less readable code or errors in loops where the increment step is more complex.",

          "conceptual_gap": "The student confuses structured exit flow (like `break` in a `for` or `while` loop) with manipulating the iteration variable. While setting `j = n` will prevent the *next* iteration from running (since `j < n` becomes false), it doesn't stop the *current* execution block (the conditional statement) immediately or prevent the loop condition check from occurring at the end of the current iteration. In this specific code, since `j=n` happens inside the `if` block, execution falls through to the implicit end of the `if` and then continues to the closing brace of the `while` loop, where the loop condition is checked before the next potential iteration.",

          "conceptual_gap": "While checking with `hasNextInt()` is good practice, the student's implementation often assigns a default value of 0 if input is missing (Lines 7, 13, 19). This obscures potential input errors and leads to incorrect runtime behavior (e.g., if the user enters non-integer data, the program silently uses 0 instead of consuming the invalid token or throwing an exception). More critically, the use of `if(x.hasNextInt())` creates a possibility where the loop relies on consuming user input but might skip consumption entirely, though in this case, the standard input buffer handles the sequential reads correctly based on the problem structure.",
