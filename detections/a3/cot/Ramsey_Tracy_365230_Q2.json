          "conceptual_gap": "The Java `Scanner.nextInt()` method only consumes the integer token, leaving any trailing whitespace (including the newline character generated when the user presses Enter after the number) in the input buffer. When the code attempts to read the names using `userInputScanner.next()` (L20), the first call reads the leftover newline character as the input for the first token, resulting in an empty or unexpected string, which disrupts subsequent input reading expectations.",
          "error_manifestation": "Runtime failure: The program produces incorrect results because the array intended for names contains unexpected values (or an extra newline character is consumed unintentionally, causing token misalignment), leading to a misinterpretation of the input sequence.",
