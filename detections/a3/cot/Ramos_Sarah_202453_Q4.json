This suggests a perceived fragility in directly using array indices within a simple assignment statement.",
          "conceptual_gap": "Java guarantees that the right-hand side of an assignment (`userInputArray[arrayIndex - 1]`) is fully evaluated before the assignment occurs to the left-hand side (`userInputArray[arrayIndex]`). The code block defining `a`, `b`, and `c` is entirely unnecessary overhead and does not simplify or clarify the basic array shift operation, which could be accomplished directly via `userInputArray[arrayIndex] = userInputArray[arrayIndex - 1];`. This indicates a lack of trust in the fundamental atomicity of array index lookups and assignments.",

They seem to treat the assignment `userInputArray[a] = c;` as if `c` is the value they calculated on the previous step, without realizing that `c` is just a temporary copy of `userInputArray[arrayIndex - 1]` and is only used once.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student is unnecessarily creating temporary, local variables (`a`, `b`, `c`) in the loop that hold redundant state (index values and the value to be assigned). While mathematically descriptive comments are sometimes helpful, defining these variables adds unnecessary computation and, in this case, obscures the direct, index-to-index assignment required for the shift: `userInputArray[arrayIndex] = userInputArray[arrayIndex - 1];`. The structure is correct, but the use of the intermediate variable `c` adds unnecessary complexity and steps. However, critically, the use of these variables does *not* cause incorrect execution in this specific implementation, but it represents a flawed approach to expressing simple array operations, likely rooted in a desire to emulate mathematical notation (`a`, `b`, `c`) where direct variable access is simpler and more efficient.",
