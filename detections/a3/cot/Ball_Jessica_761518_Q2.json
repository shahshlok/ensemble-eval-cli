          "conceptual_gap": "The student creates intermediate variables `a` and `b` (lines 24-25) to hold copies of `scores[j]` and `scores[j+1]` before the comparison. However, these local variables are never modified or used to update the array elements. The subsequent swapping logic (lines 26-28) correctly uses `scores[j]` and `scores[j+1]` and a `tempScore` helper variable, rendering `a` and `b` completely redundant and unnecessary for the function of the bubble sort algorithm. This suggests inefficiency and a potential habit of over-extracting values before comparison.",
