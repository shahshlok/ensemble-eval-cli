This implies a micro-management of the assignment process, possibly stemming from a concern that a direct assignment like `arr[i] = arr[i - 1]` might have unintended side effects or be less reliable than forcing an explicit two-step read-then-write sequence.",

          "conceptual_gap": "The assignment `int a = arr[i - 1];` (L18) only reads the value of `arr[i-1]` *at that specific moment* and stores it in `a`. In the very next line, `arr[i] = a;` (L19) uses that captured value. However, the student's code is correctly implementing the shift without using a temporary variable `a` for protection, because they overwrite `arr[i]` using `arr[i-1]`. The error usually occurs when the loop iterates in the forward direction or if they try to save intermediate state. In this specific case, the use of `a` is entirely redundant but harmless, since `arr[i]=arr[i-1]` would achieve the exact same result. The code is functionally correct for the shift, but the inclusion of the temporary variable `a` indicates a potential confusion about variable scope or necessity, even if it doesn't cause functional failure here.",
