          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that when copying a primitive value from one index to an adjacent index within a simple loop shift (A[i] = A[i-1]), they must first stage the source value in a local, temporary variable (`temporaryPreviousElementHolder`). This suggests a general belief that complex operations, even simple assignments onto arrays, require explicit temporary holding variables to ensure stability or correctness, even though the order of evaluation (`RHS` before `LHS`) makes this unnecessary.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, primitive value assignment `array[i] = array[j]` requires no intermediate temporary variable; the value at `array[j]` is fully evaluated before being assigned to `array[i]`. A temporary variable only becomes mandatory when the value being read is about to be overwritten *globally* (as correctly done for `temporaryLastElementHolder`, line 29) or during a swap operation. Introducing `temporaryPreviousElementHolder` within the loop (lines 35-36) is redundant and shows a misunderstanding of basic memory management and assignment mechanisms for primitive arrays.",

          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, standard variable assignment (`userNumberArray[a] = userNumberArray[b]`) is a direct copy operation. Variables like `temporaryPreviousElementHolder` (L30) are entirely redundant because `userNumberArray[shiftingIndex]` (L31) is directly assigned the value of `userNumberArray[shiftingIndex - 1]`. Introducing the temporary variable is inefficient and shows a lack of trust in the atomic nature of the read/write operation, but crucially, **it does not cause functional errors** in this specific context, only unnecessary computation.",
