They view sorting, often implemented defensively or inefficiently (Bubble Sort), as a mandatory initial step required to identify or easily access extreme values.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The conceptual gap lies in confusing sorting (ordering all elements, O(N^2) in this implementation) with searching (finding a single extreme element, O(N)). While the problem explicitly required sorting, the student's reliance on the final sorted index (`N-1`) suggests a mental model that defaults to full ordering even for tasks that only require searching. The mental model fails to recognize the drastic efficiency difference between finding a maximum vs. imposing total order on the data structure.",

          "conceptual_gap": "The student implements the outer loop of the Bubble Sort (which controls the number of passes needed) to iterate only up to `n_len - 1` (where `n_len` is N). Since the inner loop iterates `n_len - 1 - a` times (correctly comparing elements `b` and `b+1`), the outer loop should run for `a` from 0 up to `n_len - 2` (i.e., `a < n_len - 1`), which is what `a < n_len - 1` implements. However, a common mistake is setting the inner loop boundary incorrectly, though here it is correct (`b < n_len - 1 - a`). The structural issue is specific to the handling of `n_len - 1 - a` combined with `n_len - 1` for the outer loop, but upon deep inspection, this particular implementation of the Bubble Sort boundary for `a` is actually correct for an array of size `n_len` (it ensures `n_len - 1` passes maximum).",

          "conceptual_gap": "The assignment required the program to **sort** the data, and then **print the name and score of the student with the highest score**. The student successfully performs an *ascending* sort (lowest score first), which places the highest score at `scores[N-1]`. The error lies in the interpretation of the phrase 'sort the data based on scores in ascending order.' The user performed the required sort and correctly identified the max element afterward, leading to the correct output for this specific requirement. There is no actual divergence or misconception preventing the solution, only a slight redundancy, as finding the max score usually doesn't require a full sort. Since the prompt explicitly required sorting, the student followed instructions perfectly, and the methodology is sound for fulfilling the final print requirement after sorting.",
