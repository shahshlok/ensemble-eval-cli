          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that when copying data between two array indices (arr[idx-1] to arr[idx]), the read operation must be isolated by first storing the source value in a separate, dedicated variable ('holder') to guarantee the value is safely transferred before the destination receives the assignment. This suggests a lack of trust in the atomicity or safety of direct array index assignment.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, an assignment operator first fully evaluates the right-hand side (RHS) before performing the assignment to the left-hand side (LHS). Therefore, `arr[idx] = arr[idx - 1];` is a perfectly safe and concise operation. The creation and use of the intermediate `holder` variable adds unnecessary complexity and steps without providing any functional benefit for correctness.",

          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that when performing an array shift, they can iterate from right to left (N-1 down to 1), move the value from the previous index (i-1) into the current index (i), and successfully shift all elements one position to the right, because they incorrectly assume the value at `arr[i-1]` remains static until the loop moves to index `i-1` and overwrites it. They think the statement `int holder = arr[idx - 1];` correctly captures the *original* value needed for shifting, even though this value is itself being overwritten in the previous iteration.",
          "conceptual_gap": "An array shift requires moving elements sequentially, usually by starting from the end and copying the element from the position immediately to the left. If the array is modified *during* the loop, the overwritten value is lost and cannot be used for the subsequent copy operation. The student's use of `holder` attempts to store a value, but since `holder` is redefined inside the loop (`holder = arr[idx - 1]`) and the value at `arr[idx - 1]` is being modified/overwritten in the current iteration's parent step (`arr[idx] = holder;`), the shift operation ends up causing data duplication rather than movement.",
          "error_manifestation": "Wrong output: Instead of shifting elements (e.g., [1, 2, 3, 4] -> [4, 1, 2, 3]), the loop copies the element at index N-2 into all subsequent indices, leading to heavy value duplication (e.g., [1, 2, 3, 4] -> [4, 3, 3, 3]).",
