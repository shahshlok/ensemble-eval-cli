This ensures the loop condition is false upon re-evaluation.",
          "conceptual_gap": "While setting `i = n` achieves the required early termination, it is a non-standard and indirect method. The actual Java model provides the `break;` statement specifically for immediate, unconditional loop exit. Relying on setting the boundary variable suggests a gap in understanding or familiarity with standard control flow primitives designed for clean early termination.",

          "conceptual_gap": "The student correctly uses `i = n` to signal the loop's end, but misunderstands that only a `break` statement guarantees an instantaneous halt of the loop body and prevents subsequent iterations. When using a `while` structure, setting the control variable only signals that the condition will fail *before* the start of the *next* iteration. In this specific case, because they skip the `i = i + 1` increment, the loop does terminate correctly after detecting the first match, but the explicit `i = n` assignment is a hack signaling a lack of fluency with standard loop control mechanisms like `break` or `return` (if inside a method).",
