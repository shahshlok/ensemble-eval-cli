This forces the loop condition (`j < n`) to fail on the next cycle, effectively achieving an early termination.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student successfully implements the required logic (finding the first occurrence and stopping) but does so by manually manipulating the loop boundary variable (`j = n`).

          "conceptual_gap": "Setting `j = n` (line 25) does not halt execution instantly. The program must finish the current iteration of the loop body. The remaining `else` block logic (lines 26-27), which increments `j` if no match is found, is skipped for this iteration. However, the `while` condition (`j < n`) is checked *at the start* of the next potential iteration. If `j` is set to `n`, the loop condition evaluates to false, and the loop terminates correctly before the next element is checked. The student's method works in this specific case, but it demonstrates reliance on manipulating the loop control variable outside of its natural scope (or relying on careful structure where the only exit path is the condition check), instead of using standard control flow constructs like `break` or correctly setting up a flag and adjusting the loop logic (`while (j < n && !found)`).",
          "error_manifestation": "Logically correct output is achieved for the intended task (finding the first occurrence) despite unconventional loop control. However, this pattern often leads to errors in more complex loops (e.g., if there were code following the `if/else` block within the loop body that executed regardless of the match).",
