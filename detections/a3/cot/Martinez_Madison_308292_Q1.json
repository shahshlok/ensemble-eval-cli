          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that an iterative search must check every element in the array by looping through its entire length (j < n). They successfully handle the 'first occurrence' requirement by protecting the `index` variable from being overwritten (using `index == -1` as a condition), but they fail to recognize that the loop can, and should, terminate immediately upon a successful discovery.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In computer science, algorithms designed to find the first instance of an item should employ control flow mechanisms (like the `break` keyword) to exit the loop immediately upon finding the target. The student's flawed mental model suggests that completing the full iteration count is mandatory, even when the desired result has already been secured, leading to unnecessary computation and performance inefficiency.",
          "error_manifestation": "The program executes correctly but runs inefficiently (time complexity degradation) because it always iterates N times, regardless of whether the target is found at the beginning of the array.",

          "conceptual_gap": "The student misunderstands or neglects the ability of loop control structures (like `while` or `for`) to be prematurely terminated or bypassed using control flow statements (`break` or `return`) when the task is complete. Finding the *first* occurrence is an operation that inherently stops upon success. The student's code continues iterating through the entire array (O(N) operations) even after the first match is found, which is a structural inefficiency, though it yields the correct answer in this specific implementation because of the added condition `index == -1`.",
