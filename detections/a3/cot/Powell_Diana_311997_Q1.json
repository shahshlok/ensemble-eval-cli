The check on line 40 is logically impossible to fail given the control flow\u2014if we've reached that point, firstOccurrenceIndex must still be -1. This suggests the student believes in sequential iteration without full confidence in the break statement's terminating behavior.",

They seem to view the initialization of `firstOccurrenceIndex = -1` (L32) and its conditional check `if (firstOccurrenceIndex == -1)` (L41) as necessary protection.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student fails to recognize that the explicit use of the `break` statement (L45) immediately terminates the `while` loop upon the very first match. Because the loop starts from index 0 and proceeds sequentially, and terminates immediately upon finding the target, the index stored will *always* be the index of the first occurrence. The check `if (firstOccurrenceIndex == -1)` on line 41 is redundant and unnecessary because `firstOccurrenceIndex` can only be `-1` or the index of the first found element, and it is impossible for the program flow to reach a second successful 'if' condition (L39) within the same execution cycle/loop iteration where a match is found without breaking.",
          "error_manifestation": "The code runs correctly and produces the required output, but it contains inefficient and redundant logic, indicating a misunderstanding of how sequential loop execution combined with an immediate `break` guarantees finding the first element.",
