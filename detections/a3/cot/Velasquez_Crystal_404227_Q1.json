The actual Java execution model allows for immediate termination of the `while` loop, which significantly improves efficiency (O(1) average time complexity instead of O(N) worst-case time complexity, as the current code always takes O(N) time regardless of where the element is found). The student treats the loop boundary condition (`i<n`) as the only way a loop can end.",

They incorrectly view the initialization of `r` to -1 as a special flag that, once changed, prevents further updates, regardless of subsequent conditional checks.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student fails to implement a proper control flow mechanism (like `break` or an external boolean flag) to stop the execution of the loop once the condition for the first occurrence is met. While they use the sentinel value check `if(r==-1)`, this check is only within the `if(v==z)` block. Since the logic does not include a `break` statement after finding the result, the loop continues to iterate through the entire array. The check `if(r==-1)` correctly ensures that the index `r` is only set on the *very first time* a match is found, but the iteration continues wasting computation compared to an optimized linear search.",
