The student thinks the check is necessary to protect the variable, showing a lack of reliance on the immediate effect of the `break` statement.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student fails to recognize that using `break` immediately upon finding the first target value makes the preceding conditional check (`if (firstOccurrenceIndex == -1)`) completely redundant. When the first match (L39) is found, `firstOccurrenceIndex` must still be `-1` (its initialized value). The code sets the index (L42) and then immediately terminates the loop (L45). The inner `if` statement only serves a purpose if the loop were intended to continue iterating after the first hit.",

This guard (`if (firstOccurrenceIndex == -1)`) is seen as necessary to prevent subsequent occurrences from overwriting the index of the true first occurrence, even though the `break` statement immediately following the first assignment already ensures the loop terminates.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, control flow mechanisms like `break` immediately exit the innermost loop. Since the goal is the *first* occurrence, finding a match and immediately breaking the loop guarantees that `searchIndex` holds the index of the first match observed. The redundant `if (firstOccurrenceIndex == -1)` check is logically unnecessary because the code path that executes the assignment `firstOccurrenceIndex = searchIndex;` is immediately followed by `break;`, ensuring no later index can overwrite it. The student's flawed model includes an unnecessary safeguard against overwriting the initial finding.",
