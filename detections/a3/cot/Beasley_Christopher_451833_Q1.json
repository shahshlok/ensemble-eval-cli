This approach substitutes the use of explicit control flow mechanisms like the `break` statement.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The operational gap is not one of execution failure\u2014the code works correctly\u2014but one of understanding Java's explicit control flow features. The standard mechanism for immediate loop termination is the `break` keyword. Relying on modifying a state variable (`k`) that is simultaneously used for output storage and loop control, although effective here, obscures the intent and is less maintainable than using `break;` after the assignment `k=i;`",

          "conceptual_gap": "The student has successfully implemented the logic to find the index and handle the not-found case (`k=-1`). The only divergence is in the specific output formatting required by the sample run vs. the logic used in the code. The problem description asks only to 'Print the index', or '-1'. The sample run output added context 'Found at index: '. The student code adheres strictly to the requirement derived from the sample run's pattern, but might fail if the problem intended strictly '1' or '2' instead of 'Found at index: 1', but that's a minor formatting adherence to the sample rather than a conceptual error in programming logic.",
