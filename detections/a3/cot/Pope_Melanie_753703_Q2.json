The student incorrectly uses `N - 1` as the upper bound for the inner loop index `j` during iteration control, failing to account for indexing to `j + 1` inside the loop body, which is required for comparison and swap.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In a robust bubble sort implementation for an array of size `N`, the inner loop must ensure that `j + 1` never exceeds `N - 1` (the last valid index). Therefore, the condition for the inner loop should be `j < N - 1 - i`. The student correctly uses `j < N - 1 - i` (line 26), but the outer loop index `i` runs through `N - 1` passes. If the array size N is 3, the loops are: i=0 (j=0, 1), i=1 (j=0). This implementation is actually a standard bubble sort and is **structurally correct** for sorting, despite the confusing repetition of `N-1` in the code. The problem lies not in the sorting logic indices but in the initialization of the output variables *after* sorting.",

The core execution is correct for the problem constraints, but the specific requirement 4: 'The program should sort the data based on scores in ascending order' and requirement 5: 'Print the name and score of the student with the highest score' suggests the student successfully linked ascending sort to finding the maximum element at the end of the array.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The sort condition `if (scores_array[j] > scores_array[j + 1])` (line 27) correctly sorts the array in ascending order. If the requirements had specified descending order, this logic would be flawed. Since the student correctly implemented ascending sort and correctly retrieved the element at `N-1`, this analysis confirms the implementation meets the requirement, though slightly implicitly.
