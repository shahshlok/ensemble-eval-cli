This suggests a lack of trust in or understanding of the standard direct comparison mechanism available in Java.",

          "conceptual_gap": "The purpose of line 25 (`int c = a - b;`) is redundant and potentially dangerous. While in the specific test case (`N=3` and scores are small), `a - b` does not overflow and provides the correct comparison result, relying on subtraction results (`c > 0`) to determine order is equivalent to simply checking `a > b`. Crucially, if the intermediate subtraction result (`a - b`) exceeds `Integer.MAX_VALUE` or falls below `Integer.MIN_VALUE` (e.g., if scores were very large positive and small negative numbers, or vice versa), the overflow could flip the sign, leading to incorrect sorting logic. The standard and safe approach is always to compare the original values directly: `if (scores_array[j] > scores_array[j + 1])` or derived from the temporary variables: `if (a > b)`. The use of `c` adds complexity and risk without benefit.",
