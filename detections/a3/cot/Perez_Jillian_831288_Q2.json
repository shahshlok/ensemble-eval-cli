          "conceptual_gap": "The conceptual gap is not in the sorting mechanism itself (the Bubble Sort correctly sorts the data in ascending order), but in linking the sorting goal (finding the highest score) with the necessary comparison operator and final array access. Since the requirement is to find the student with the *highest* score, sorting in ascending order means the highest score is correctly placed at the index 'n - 1'. The student correctly identifies that the last element of an ascendingly sorted list holds the maximum value. Therefore, there is no fundamental notional error in variable mutation or execution flow, but a potentially misplaced focus on the sorting step when a simpler max-finding algorithm was sufficient, or a misunderstanding of how ascending sort results relate to requirements that often imply descending order (leaderboards). However, since the code *works* for the requirement to find the largest element using `scores[n-1]`, I must conclude the logic flow is functional, and any conceptual gap based on *divergence* is minimal, relating only to efficiency or common practice.",

The student interprets the sorting requirement strictly as an intermediate mandatory step rather than realizing that a single pass search for the maximum value (O(N) complexity) would satisfy the main goal (finding the top student) much more efficiently than a full sort (O(N^2) complexity for Bubble Sort).",
          "conceptual_gap": "This reflects a gap in algorithmic efficiency awareness. While the code correctly executes the Bubble Sort and finds the maximum element after sorting, the student fails to select the most suitable (least complex) algorithm to achieve the specific output requirement (finding the maximum) when sorting is not strictly required for later operations.",
