          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that introducing a temporary variable (`temp_holder`) inside the loop, and assigning it the value `arr[i - 1]` (the source value for the current shift), helps maintain the integrity of the array's original state during the shifting process. They use `temp_holder` to move the element one position right, but fail to realize that `arr[i - 1]` itself changes in the *next* iteration (when `i` decreases), causing the value carried by `temp_holder` to be overwritten immediately by the already shifted value.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student misunderstands that array shifting requires sequential assignment where the source index (`i - 1`) must contain the original data needed for the current iteration (`arr[i] = arr[i - 1]`). By introducing and using `temp_holder = arr[i - 1]` inside the loop, the student is redundantly creating a storage location for a value that is already correct and available at `arr[i - 1]` for that iteration. Crucially, the use of `temp_holder` doesn't prevent `arr[i - 1]` from being the target of an assignment in the *next* iteration (when `i` becomes `i-1`), meaning the newly shifted value leaks backward prematurely. The correct implementation relies simply on `arr[i] = arr[i - 1]` without an internal temporary variable, as overwriting proceeds correctly from high index to low index using the original value stored at `i-1` before it is itself overwritten in the previous step.",
          "error_manifestation": "Wrong output: The elements are not all shifted correctly. Instead of shifting, the elements (after the first one) are copied forward repeatedly, resulting in duplicates of the element initially at `arr[N-2]`, or whatever is left at `arr[1]` before it is correctly assigned.",
