If there are `N` elements, only `N-1` passes are strictly necessary for the outer loop to guarantee sorting. Iterating the outer loop `N` times (from `outerIndex = 0` to `outerIndex < N`) is redundant, but critically, iterating the inner loop up to `numberOfStudents - 1` *inside* the outer loop on *every* pass executes one too many comparisons required across the entire sorting process when combined with the `N` passes of the outer loop. More importantly, using `while (innerIndex < numberOfStudents - 1)` for the inner loop is correct for the comparisons, but when combined with `while (outerIndex < numberOfStudents)`, it leads to redundancy, though it doesn't cause incorrect output in this specific implementation due to the indices being constrained correctly relative to `numberOfStudents - 1` and `numberOfStudents - 2` respectively.",
