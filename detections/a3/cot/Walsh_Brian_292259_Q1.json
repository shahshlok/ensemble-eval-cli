          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that it is necessary to explicitly check if the successful search index (`found_index`) is equal to the initial sentinel value (`-1`) before printing the output, even though the print statements are split into an `if/else` block based on this exact condition, and the required output format for failure includes the index label 'Found at index:'.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The conceptual gap is not about execution logic, but about efficiency and adherence to the problem specification regarding output structure in the failure case. The student's code prints 'Found at index: -1' when the index is -1. While correct in result, the student failed to notice or trust that the failure case *must* print the index -1. The redundant output instruction in the failure branch (line 28) explicitly prints 'Found at index: -1', even though the existing logic derived `found_index` to be -1, meaning the code could have just printed `found_index` directly in both success and failure cases if the problem had specified only printing the value '-1' in the failure case. However, given the specific sample output requirement ('Found at index: -1'), the student duplicated the label in the failure branch, suggesting they weren't generalizing the output structure.",
