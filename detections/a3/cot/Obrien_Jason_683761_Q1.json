This indicates a misunderstanding of when variable abstraction is necessary.",
          "conceptual_gap": "Java permits the direct use of constant literals (0) and existing system variables (`N`) within the loop definition (`for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)`). Introducing temporary variables `a` and `b` adds unnecessary cognitive overhead and redundancy without changing the resulting machine behavior, demonstrating a lack of understanding regarding efficient and idiomatic variable usage for simple loop control.",

          "conceptual_gap": "The use of `int a = 0;` and `int b = N;` is unnecessary boilerplate. While harmless, it demonstrates a failure to utilize primitive literals or array properties (`arr.length`) directly within the loop structure, adding clutter without functional benefit. The student may not fully trust or understand the direct use of 0 for starting index or N for the loop limit in the `for` construct.",

Although `c` correctly holds the index, the approach of initializing it to -1 is strictly necessary for fulfilling the 'not found' requirement, but initializing and carrying this variable throughout the trace suggests a mental model focused on ensuring a required default state is established early.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In terms of logic, initializing `c = -1` (Line 22) is correct and necessary for the required behavior if the loop finishes without a match. We classify this as a mild conceptual note rather than an error, as it relates to the robust initialization required for sentinel values in search algorithms, which can sometimes be done more elegantly, but the current implementation is sound. The student correctly applies the pattern of using a sentinel value.",
