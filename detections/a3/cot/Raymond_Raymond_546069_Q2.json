They might be reluctant to use direct relational operators on array indexing (`scores[j] > scores[j+1]`), possibly seeing the direct comparison as less reliable or requiring the calculation of intermediate state regardless.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The Java execution model supports direct logical comparison using relational operators (e.g., `>`) on complex expressions like array accesses, simplifying the decision logic. By introducing three unnecessary intermediate variables (`a`, `b`, `c`) and an arithmetic operation (subtraction) solely for comparison, the student demonstrates a failure to utilize efficient control flow constructs, suggesting an overly procedural, low-level mental model for simple conditional checks.",
