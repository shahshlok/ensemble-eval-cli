However, the student might still believe that methods like .toUpperCase() or .replace() attempt, or internally cause, a partial modification of the string object referenced by 'y' itself, and the assignment is merely required to finalize or commit this change, rather than understanding that the methods strictly create and return an entirely new string object because the original is untouchable.",
          "conceptual_gap": "Java strings are strictly immutable. Methods like .toUpperCase() and .replace() never modify the existing string object; they always allocate and return a completely new object. The assignment `y = ...` is not confirming a change, but updating the variable `y` (a pointer) to reference the new, modified string object. The student's code is technically correct because they included the necessary assignments, but this pattern often compensates for a fundamental misunderstanding of immutability versus assignment.",
