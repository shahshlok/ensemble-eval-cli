          "conceptual_gap": "In efficient $O(N^2)$ sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, the sorting process requires only $N-1$ passes (outer loop iterations). Furthermore, the inner comparison loop should shrink dynamically because the largest element of the unsorted portion settles into its final position at the end of the array after each pass. The student executes redundant passes (i=0 to n, instead of i=0 to n-2) and redundant comparisons within each pass (j runs N-1 times regardless of the pass index i).",

They miss the requirement for enough passes (N passes total) to guarantee that all elements bubble up to their correct position.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student implemented only the inner comparison and swapping loop for a bubble sort algorithm, which performs only one pass over the array (controlled by the variable `i` running from 0 to n-1). A complete bubble sort requires a second, outer loop that ensures the inner comparison loop runs enough times (N-1 times) to fully sort the data. Since the code only executes one full pass, the resulting array is frequently only partially sorted, or sometimes completely unsorted if the largest element is not at the end of the first pass due to subsequent larger elements being encountered earlier.",

While the inner loop limit is generally correct for comparisons involving `j+1`, running the *outer* loop exactly `n` times suggests they might misunderstand how many passes are necessary (N-1 passes are sufficient) or they are simply using the array size inconsistently across the initialization and iteration phases.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In bubble sort implementations, the outer loop (which dictates the number of passes) typically runs N-1 times, as the array is guaranteed to be sorted after N-1 passes.
