          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that array assignments within a loop, specifically transferring a value from `arr_numbers[i-1]` to `arr_numbers[i]`, require an explicit intermediate variable (`temp_holder`) to 'safely' hold the source value. This stems from confusing simple assignment with the multiple, synchronized steps required for swapping two variables, or assuming that the evaluation of the left-hand side might interfere with the reading of the right-hand side.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The Java execution model guarantees that the expression on the Right-Hand Side (`arr_numbers[i - 1]`) is fully evaluated to a value before the assignment operation writes that value to the Left-Hand Side (`arr_numbers[i]`). Therefore, the use of `temp_holder` is entirely redundant, demonstrating a flawed mental model regarding the atomicity and security of basic assignment statements in Java.",

          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that when performing an array shift/copy operation where an element `A[i-1]` is copied to `A[i]`, they must first store the value `A[i-1]` into a temporary variable (`temp_holder` on Line 46) before assigning it to `A[i]` (Line 47), even though the variable `arr_numbers[i-1]` will not be overwritten until the previous loop iteration or is never needed again.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java (and most imperative languages), when assigning `arr_numbers[i] = arr_numbers[i - 1];`, the right-hand side `arr_numbers[i - 1]` is read immediately before the assignment takes place. Storing this value in a local variable `temp_holder` (`int temp_holder = arr_numbers[i - 1];`) immediately followed by `arr_numbers[i] = temp_holder;` is redundant and unnecessary complexity for a simple shift operation. While it does not cause an error here, it indicates a lack of understanding regarding the immediate, sequential nature of assignment operations versus the necessity of temporary variables when overwriting values required later.",
