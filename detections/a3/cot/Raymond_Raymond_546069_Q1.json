          "conceptual_gap": "The code is functionally correct because `c` is calculated as `N`. However, the introduction of unnecessary state variables (`a`, `b`, `c`) and the arithmetic derivation of the loop limit (`c = b - a`) suggests the student attempts to apply boundary concepts learned from complex algorithms (like binary search index management or sub-array slicing) to a simple, full-array linear iteration. The conceptual gap is the over-complication of basic array indexing, failing to recognize that `i < N` is the idiomatic and sufficient termination condition.",

Specifically, the student calculates the loop limit `c` as the difference between fixed boundary markers `b` (N) and `a` (0), suggesting they are modeling a dynamic sub-array search or perhaps confusing array iteration with array length calculation, rather than simply iterating `i < N`.",

The student's introduction of `a=0`, `b=N`, and `c=b-a` (which equals `N`) is mathematically redundant for this context. While it does not cause a runtime error here, it indicates a flawed or overly complex mental model for loop boundary definition, possibly rooted in experiences with paradigms like C pointers, or an earlier implementation of binary search that requires explicit boundaries.
