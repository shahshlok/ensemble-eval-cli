          "conceptual_gap": "While `Scanner.next()` *can* read tokens from a single line of input, the program structure encourages the user to provide all strings on one line (Line 9: `System.out.print(\"Enter names: \");` followed by a loop using `s.next()`). However, if the user enters multiple names (e.g., 'Alice Bob Charlie') on one line, subsequent calls to `s.next()` (Line 12) for the scores will fail to prompt the user again if there are still tokens left in the scanner buffer. The provided sample run suggests this input style works, but it masks the underlying poor design choice of reading all name tokens using `s.next()` in sequence instead of using `s.nextLine()` and parsing, or prompting for one name at a time.",
          "error_manifestation": "Wrong output or input behavior mismatch depending on user input style. In the context of the provided sample run, this input pattern (`Alice Bob Charlie`) only works because the student expects all tokens to be consumed efficiently.",
