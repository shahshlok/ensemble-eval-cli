          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that after finding and recording the index of the first occurrence of the target (`T`), the program must continue iterating through the remaining elements of the array. They correctly use a conditional check (`if(y == -1)`) to preserve the index of the first find, but they fail to recognize that the iteration can be stopped immediately after the first match is secured.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In the Java execution model, control flow mechanisms like the `break` statement exist to exit loops prematurely when an objective is fulfilled. The student is executing the iteration model too literally, failing to apply early termination logic common to search algorithms. This results in unnecessary processing after the first match is found, leading to suboptimal time complexity.",

They intend `if (y == -1)` to act as a flag check to prevent subsequent matches from overwriting the index of the initial match.",
          "conceptual_gap": "While the logic `if (y == -1) y = i;` does correctly capture the index of the first match and prevents overwriting, this conditional check is unnecessary complexity when searching for the first occurrence. The standard, more efficient Java execution model involves using a `break` statement (or a `return` if in a function) immediately after finding the first match to terminate the search loop early. Because the student avoids using `break`, their loop continues iterating through the entire array even after the first match is found, leading to unnecessary operations and potential confusion about termination conditions, though the final output is correct for the problem constraints.",
