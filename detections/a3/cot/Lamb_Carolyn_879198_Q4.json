          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that when performing the array shift using a `while` loop starting from `n-1` down to `1`, the loop condition `i > 0` correctly handles the full range of elements that need to be copied (from index `n-2` down to index `0`). They mistake the loop boundary for covering all necessary copies.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The array shift requires copying elements from index `n-2` to `n-1`, down to copying index `0` to index `1`. This means the loop should run as long as the destination index `i` is greater than or equal to 1. The student uses `while (i > 0)`, which correctly covers copying `numbers[n-2]` to `numbers[n-1]`, down to copying `numbers[0]` to `numbers[1]`. However, this is not a misconception but rather a successful implementation of the core shifting logic. The student code *correctly* implements the right shift. Since the logic for shifting is correct, no notional misconception is present in the core algorithm implementation.",
