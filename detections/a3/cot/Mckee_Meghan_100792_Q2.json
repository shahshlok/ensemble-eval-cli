          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that when iterating through an array or array segment of size N, the loop condition `arrayIndex < arraySize` should be replaced or augmented by checking against the index of the last element already processed, especially if the array size is derived from a counter that started at 0 or 1, resulting in a loop accessing elements beyond the intended bounds.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In the context of the selection sort inner loop, the student starts the `innerLoopIndex` (ILI) at `outerLoopIndex + 1`, which is correct for checking the unsorted sub-array. The loop termination condition `while (innerLoopIndex < numberOfStudents)` correctly ensures ILI does not exceed the valid array bounds (0 to `numberOfStudents - 1`). However, the student incorrectly assumes that the outer loop condition `while (outerLoopIndex < numberOfStudents)` must iterate up to, but not including, the last element to successfully sort N elements. Selection sort requires the outer loop to run `N-1` times (i.e., `outerLoopIndex` from 0 to `N-2`). When `outerLoopIndex` equals `N-1`, the loop executes one final time. Inside, `innerLoopIndex` starts at `N-1 + 1 = N`, which immediately causes the inner loop condition (`N < N`) to fail. This unnecessary iteration of the outside loop, while benign in this specific implementation because the inner loop doesn't run, demonstrates confusion about array boundaries and typical loop termination conventions (e.g., iterating up to `N-1` when accessing all elements).",
