This indicates a conceptual preference for splitting a single array assignment statement (`arr[idx] = arr[idx-1]`) into explicit read-and-write steps using an unnecessary intermediate stack variable.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The Java assignment statement evaluates the right-hand side completely before performing the assignment to the left-hand side. Therefore, the direct assignment `arr[idx] = arr[idx - 1];` would correctly perform the shift without requiring the variable `holder`. The introduction of `holder` does not prevent any race conditions or memory error (as none exist here) and merely adds unnecessary complexity and inefficiency, reflecting a cautious or overly literal interpretation of data movement.",

          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that when iterating backward through an array to shift elements right (where `arr[idx] = arr[idx - 1]`), assigning `arr[idx - 1]` to a temporary variable (`holder`) preserves the original value of `arr[idx - 1]` across subsequent loop iterations, allowing it to be used later for shifting values further down the line. Essentially, they think `holder` maintains a snapshot of the *original* array state, independent of changes to `arr[idx - 1]` inside the loop.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student confuses the scope and persistence of the `holder` variable. Since `int holder = arr[idx - 1];` is executed inside the `while` loop (L31), it captures the value of `arr[idx - 1]` *at that specific index and iteration*. The line `arr[idx] = holder;` (L32) correctly performs the shift for the current index. However, in the *next* iteration (when `idx` decrements), `arr[idx - 1]` has usually already been overwritten (in the previous iteration's L32 execution). The student's implementation successfully propagates only the value of the second-to-last element (`arr[N-2]`) repeatedly because it's the first value read into `holder` that hasn't been overwritten yet, before all subsequent elements (i.e., `arr[idx - 1]` for `idx < N-1`) have already taken on the value of their left neighbor.",
