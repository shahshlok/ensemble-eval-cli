This check is necessary to guarantee finding the *first* index, even though they also implemented an immediate 'break' which achieves the same goal without the conditional check.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student implemented conflicting control flow logic for finding the first occurrence. Because the search is sequential (starting at index 0) and includes an immediate `break` (L45) upon finding the target (L40), the resulting index stored in `firstOccurrenceIndex` is always guaranteed to be that of the first occurrence. The inner check on line 42 (`if (firstOccurrenceIndex == -1)`) is therefore redundant. This indicates a hesitant or combined mental model, where the student mixes the logic for a full array scan (where the conditional check is required) with the logic for an early terminating scan (where the conditional check is superfluous).",

Specifically, the student seems to think that the initial assignment of `firstOccurrenceIndex = -1` isn't definitive enough to ensure only the first match is recorded, thus requiring an explicit check `if (firstOccurrenceIndex == -1)` inside the loop, even though the `break` statement handles terminating the search upon finding the very first match.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In programming, if a loop is designed to exit immediately upon finding the first desired element (using `break`), any logic intended to find only the 'first' element is redundant inside the `if` block. The simple assignment `firstOccurrenceIndex = searchIndex` followed by `break` is sufficient to guarantee the index of the first match is stored before termination. The student's added check (`if (firstOccurrenceIndex == -1)`) introduces complexity without contributing to correctness when `break` is present, suggesting a lack of confidence or misunderstanding in how `break` fundamentally guarantees 'first occurrence' behavior.",
