They expect this assignment to directly cause the loop conditional check 'i < n' to fail in the immediately subsequent cycle, thereby serving as an equivalent substitute for the 'break' keyword.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student fails to use the idiomatic and robust control flow statement, 'break', which is designed specifically for immediate loop termination. Manipulating the loop counter ('i = n;') works incidentally due to the specific sequence of operations in the Java 'for' loop (where 'i++' executes before the condition check 'i < n' and results in 'i' becoming n+1), but relying on modifying the iteration variable is brittle and demonstrates an avoidance or ignorance of the correct control flow primitive.",

Setting `i = n` inside the loop body does not immediately stop the current iteration or prevent the update step. The loop continues to execute the instructions remaining in the current iteration. Critically, after the current iteration finishes, `i` is incremented to `n + 1` by the update step (`i++`), and *then* the condition (`n + 1 < n`) is evaluated, causing termination. While this approach eventually stops the loop after identifying the target, it is an indirect and brittle way to achieve immediate termination.
