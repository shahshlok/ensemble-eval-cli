          "conceptual_gap": "The student heavily relies on creating disposable temporary variables (`a`, `b`, `c`) for simple, one-time calculations (`N-1`, `N-2`) or constants (`0`), rather than integrating these simple expressions directly into the loop control or array indexing. While not fundamentally incorrect for small programs, it suggests a lack of efficiency in variable usage and perhaps an overly rigid approach to breaking down simple arithmetic.",
