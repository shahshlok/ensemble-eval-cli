This suggests an unnecessary reliance on explicit buffering even when direct assignment is non-destructive.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The purpose of a temporary variable is typically to save a value that is about to be overwritten (as in a swap). In this shifting loop, the value `arr[i - 1]` is only being read, not written to, so the direct assignment `arr[i] = arr[i - 1];` is correct, safe, and efficient. Introducing `temp` is redundant and suggests the student over-generalized the idiom required for swapping elements to simple shifting operations.",

          "conceptual_gap": "The student introduces an unnecessary variable (`temp`) to store an intermediate value during a direct assignment operation. While this approach is logically sound (it correctly copies `arr[i-1]` to `arr[i]`), it indicates a potential lack of understanding regarding the direct variable assignment mechanism in Java, where `arr[i] = arr[i - 1]` directly performs the required copy without needing an extra temporary step to hold the source value.",
