          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that printing '-1' when the element is not found should be handled only in the `else` block corresponding to `if (indexFound != -1)`. However, the problem statement implies two distinct output formats: A success message (`Found at index: X`) or a failure result (`-1`). The student failed to realize that when the element is not found, the output must strictly be '-1' and not be prefixed by a descriptive string if the success state is absent.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The conceptual gap is not about Java execution but about interpreting and implementing output requirements. The student correctly uses `if/else` logic to control flow based on whether `indexFound` remains at the sentinel value (-1). The error lies in the presentation layer: when the element is found, they print the required format ('Found at index: ' + indexFound), but when it is not found (indexFound == -1), they print only the required failure value (-1), neglecting the possibility that the required output format for the 'not found' case might need specific formatting if it were different from just the number -1. In this specific case, the output matches the required *value* but misses the required *prefix* if such a prefix had been necessary for failure cases, leading to a direct output of '-1'. Since the requirement specifically asks to 'Print -1' if not found, the student's output is technically correct based on the *exact* literal specification of the output value, but structurally deviates from the sample run's implicit requirement of a consistent print format which is not fully enforced by the prompt text. Given the high confidence that the logic is correct and the failure is only in strict format replication (which isn't violated here), I must reassess the error.",
