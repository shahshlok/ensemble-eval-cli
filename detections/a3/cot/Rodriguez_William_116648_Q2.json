They assume this difference calculation works identically to `scores[b+1] < scores[b]` for determining if a swap is necessary for ascending order.",
          "conceptual_gap": "While subtraction (`c < 0`) works mathematically for comparisons in many cases, relying on `int` subtraction to determine relative order can lead to silent arithmetic overflow/underflow if the difference between two comparable `int` values exceeds the range of `int` (i.e., if `scores[b+1]` and `scores[b]` are near opposite bounds of `Integer.MAX_VALUE` and `Integer.MIN_VALUE`). Although this specific implementation does not fail with typical scores, it demonstrates a vulnerability compared to using a direct relational comparison (`scores[b+1] < scores[b]`), which is the standard and robust method for sorting basic types in Java.",

          "conceptual_gap": "In the inner loop, the condition is `b < N - 1 - a`. When `a = 0`, this is `b < N - 1`. The largest value `b` takes is `N - 2`. Inside the loop, the code accesses `scores[b + 1]`. When `b = N - 2`, `b + 1 = N - 1`, which is the correct last index. However, the outer loop condition is also `a < N - 1`. This loop controls how many passes are made. For an array of size $N$, $N-1$ passes are sufficient (or $N$ passes for robustness, though $N-1$ is optimal). The current outer loop terminates after $N-1$ passes, which is correct for sorting $N$ elements. The overall sorting logic and termination criteria appear correct for standard Bubble Sort implementation despite the redundancy in declaring unused variables `a, b, c` before the loops.",
