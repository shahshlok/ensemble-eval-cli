          "conceptual_gap": "Java provides the `break` keyword specifically for immediate and explicit loop termination. The student's reliance on setting the loop variable `idx = N` works in this case because of the implicit execution order (loop body finishes, then `idx++` runs, then condition check fails), but it bypasses standard structured control flow constructs. This suggests a mental model that prioritizes state manipulation (variable assignment) over dedicated instruction semantics (`break`) for managing control flow.",

          "conceptual_gap": "Setting the loop counter variable (`idx`) within the loop body does not immediately terminate the loop in Java. After the if block completes (L48), the loop control flow proceeds to the update statement (`idx++`) defined in the `for` header (L44), and then re-evaluates the condition (`idx < N`). If `idx` was set to `N`, the update `idx++` makes it `N + 1`. The loop condition check then fails, terminating the loop. However, the student intended to exit the loop immediately upon finding the first match. By setting `idx = N` (L48), the loop *will* terminate, but only after `idx` is incremented to `N+1` and the next condition check occurs. For a correct, immediate exit, the student should use `break;` (or structure the loop as a `while(true)` with a conditional `return`/`break`). Due to this method, if there are subsequent occurrences *after* the first one, the loop continues iterating and potentially overwriting `found_index` if the student forgot to use `break`, which is the correct way to handle early exit in a `for` loop.",

More subtly, they may not fully understand the for-loop execution order: even after setting idx = N, the loop's increment operation (idx++) still executes before the condition is re-checked.
