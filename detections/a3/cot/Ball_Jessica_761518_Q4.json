This behavior suggests they may be over-applying patterns used for more complex operations (like swapping) or are concerned about potential side effects if they use a direct assignment (`arr[i] = arr[i-1]`).",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, assigning a primitive type value (like an `int`) from one array location to another creates a simple copy of the value. The direct assignment `arr[i] = arr[i - 1];` achieves the exact same result as the two-step process using variable `a` but is simpler and more efficient, as `arr[i-1]` is not modified during the loop iteration. The intermediate variable `a` adds unnecessary complexity.",

          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that assigning a variable (like 'a' on line 20) within a loop iteration stores the value *before* any subsequent modifications occur in that iteration, and that this variable reference ensures the original value is preserved implicitly for the array assignment (line 21), even though the array itself is mutable and being modified during the shift.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student fails to recognize the difference between assigning an array element directly and using a temporary scalar variable to hold intermediate values. The purpose of a temporary variable in a shift operation is usually to hold the value being overwritten, or in a right shift, to hold the value being moved *from* the left (index `i-1`) to the right (index `i`). However, because the array `arr` is mutated on line 21 (`arr[i] = a;`), and subsequently `arr[i-1]` is read on line 20 in the *next* iteration, the newly written value (which is a duplicate) is read instead of the original, unshifted value. The variable `a` is purely a temporary local copy that does not protect against array corruption when reading from `arr[i-1]` in the next loop iteration.",
          "error_manifestation": "Wrong output: Expected '4 1 2 3', received '4 1 1 1'. The array elements are overwritten with duplicates, propagating the value of the earliest element in the shifting section.",
