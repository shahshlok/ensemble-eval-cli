They appear to distrust the safety or atomicity of a direct assignment expression like y[j] = y[j-1]. This suggests a perceived need to strictly isolate the read and write operations, perhaps stemming from confusion about potential variable corruption or unwanted side effects.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, assigning primitive values (like integers) is a simple value copy. Since the loop is iterating backward (j decreases from n-1 to 1), the element y[j-1] is guaranteed to hold the correct, untouched value intended for y[j]. The use of the temporary variable 'h' declared inside the loop iteration is redundant. Direct assignment `y[j]=y[j-1]` achieves the same result more efficiently. The reliance on `h` suggests an overly cautious or complex mental model of assignment flow.",

          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that by storing an array element `y[j-1]` into a temporary variable `h` inside the loop, the value of `h` will automatically update if the array element `y[j-1]` changes in a subsequent iteration, or perhaps that the variable `h` maintains a reference to the array cell, not just a copy of the value.",
          "conceptual_gap": "When an array element `y[j-1]` is read and assigned to a primitive variable `h` (L20: `int h=y[j-1];`), Java copies the integer value. The variable `h` is local to that loop iteration and holds a static numerical value from the array at that specific moment. When the student intends to use `h` (L21: `y[j]=h;`), they are using the outdated or unmodified value stored in `h` from the current iteration, rather than efficiently overwriting `y[j]` directly with `y[j-1]` before `y[j-1]` itself is potentially overwritten in an earlier step of the loop.\n\nThe core error is that the use of `h` adds unnecessary complexity and the student fails to recognize that the direct assignment `y[j] = y[j-1]` is safer and cleaner, or that their current structure requires `h` to be defined outside the loop if they intended it to track values across iterations, which is not the case here. This specific misuse led to copying `y[j-1]` before immediately assigning it back to `y[j]` within the same step, masking the intended `y[j] = y[j-1]` shift, resulting in corrupted data (duplication of the first element).",
