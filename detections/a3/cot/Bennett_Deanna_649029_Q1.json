          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that printing the outcome requires separate, explicit control flow based on the final value of the result variable (`firstIndex`), even though the variable was specifically initialized to the 'not found' value (-1) and only updated upon a successful find. This indicates a reliance on the initial value of the sentinel as the sole indicator of failure, necessitating a final conditional check.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The code correctly implements the logic, but the conceptual gap lies in efficiency and flow control understanding. Since `firstIndex` is initialized to -1 (the 'not found' state) and the search loop correctly uses `break` upon finding the first index, the value of `firstIndex` *at the end of the loop* is guaranteed to be either -1 (if not found) or the correct positive index (if found). The student checks if `firstIndex == -1` and prints \"Found at index: -1\", or else prints the value. This structure, although correct, suggests a potential unnecessary level of complexity or verbosity in handling the output, treating the sentinel value (-1) as a special case for outputting the static string \"-1\" rather than just printing the final variable value, which would still be correct. A more direct implementation would eliminate the `if (firstIndex == -1)` block and just use `System.out.println(\"Found at index: \" + firstIndex);`",
