          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that initializing the index to -1 and assigning the index 'i' upon finding a match is sufficient to find the *first* occurrence, regardless of remaining loop iterations, because the problem specifies 'first'. The student fails to recognize that without a `break` statement, the loop continues iterating and overwrites the index with subsequent matches, effectively finding the *last* occurrence if multiple matches exist.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student misunderstands the flow of control in a loop when searching for the first instance. The Java execution model requires an explicit `break` statement or early return to stop iteration immediately upon finding the desired element. Simply finding the element and assigning the index does not automatically terminate the search process.",
