          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that combined loop conditions using the logical AND operator (`&&`) will short-circuit, and that the loop counter (`i`) only increments *after* the successful condition (`y == -1`) is first broken/satisfied, thus retaining the correct index in `i` just before `y` is updated.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student correctly uses `y = i;` to store the index when the target is found. However, the subsequent increment `i++;` (Line 13) executes unconditionally *before* the loop re-evaluates its condition. Crucially, the loop condition `y == -1` prevents further iterations, but the structure ensures `i` is incremented one last time immediately after `y` is set to the correct index, causing `i` to point *one past* the index where the match occurred. The student intends to stop iterating but fails to prevent the post-match increment of the loop counter.",
          "error_manifestation": "None. This specific implementation is functionally correct for finding the first occurrence, *despite* the redundant post-condition increment, because the value `y` holds the correct index, and the loop terminates immediately thereafter due to `y != -1`. Had the intent been to use `i` as the result variable immediately after loop exit, the code would be incorrect. Since `y` is used for the result, the logic works, but reveals a misunderstanding of how loop structures and conditional termination interact with loop variable updates.",
