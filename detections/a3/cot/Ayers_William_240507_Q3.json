However, given that this is a common point of error for beginners (who often omit the assignment), the student might lack a deep conceptual understanding, believing that string methods perform a partial or implicit in-place mutation, and the outer `y =` is merely a necessary syntax boilerplate or defensive measure, rather than an essential operation to update the reference to a newly created string object.",
          "conceptual_gap": "Java strings are strictly immutable. Methods like `toUpperCase()` and `replace()` always return a new string object and never modify the original object. Therefore, reassigning the variable reference (`y = ...`) is mandatory for the changes to take effect on that variable. Although the student performed the mandatory reassignment, suggesting compliance, the mental model might still contain a subtle flaw regarding the strict non-mutability of the original object.",
          "error_manifestation": "The student's code is functionally correct and produces the required output. The conceptual gap would only manifest as an error (wrong output: 'hello world') if the assignment operator (`y =`) were mistakenly omitted on Line 7.",
