If the condition `v==w` is met, setting `j=n` on L27 is followed immediately by the implicit jump to L29, and then the condition L22 is checked. If the loop was supposed to exit, the student should use `break` instead of manipulating the loop variable `j` like this, especially since the flow includes an `else` branch that increments `j` when the condition is not met.",

Although this specific implementation works *purely by chance* because the `if` block executes, sets `r`, sets `j=n`, and then skips the `else` block incrementing $j$ (L28), this style of early exit is highly error-prone and indicates the student doesn't fully grasp the `break` statement or definitive loop control flow.",
