This suggests an overgeneralization of the requirement for temporary storage from element swapping operations to simple copying operations.",
          "conceptual_gap": "Java allows direct assignment `arr[i] = arr[i - 1]`, which correctly reads the value at `arr[i-1]` and writes it to `arr[i]`. Introducing a local temporary variable `temp` (`int temp = arr[i - 1]; arr[i] = temp;`) within the loop is functionally correct but computationally and stylistically redundant, demonstrating a misunderstanding of the immediate nature of simple assignment operations.",

The assignment `arr[i] = arr[i-1];` is atomical enough for a simple copy operation in this context before the value of `arr[i-1]` is potentially modified in a future context or iteration. When shifting elements, copying directly `arr[i] = arr[i-1];` achieves the goal correctly, whereas the introduction of `temp` here, combined with the student's misunderstanding of loop execution (see previous misconception), leads to errors.",
