          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, assigning the loop variable to the termination condition (e.g., `i=n;`) only guarantees termination before the *next* iteration. However, if there are subsequent operations in the current iteration block after the assignment (but before the loop condition check), those operations will still execute. When searching for the *first* occurrence, immediate termination via `break` is necessary. Relying on setting the counter variable is brittle, prone to missing post-assignment code execution, and less idiomatic than `break`.",
          "error_manifestation": "The code fails to terminate immediately upon finding the first match. While the `r` variable is correctly updated, the loop continues execution (or tries to) until the end of the current iteration, which is semantically correct for this specific problem instance (since only `i` is modified after `r=i`). The approach is conceptually flawed because it replaces the standard `break` mechanism with manual counter manipulation.",

In the success path, they manually set `i=n` to terminate, and in the failure path, they use `i++` to proceed to the next iteration. They fail to recognize that the `else` block already contains the logic for progressing the loop (i.e., `i++`), and placing an `i++` implicitly after the entire `if/else` block would simplify the structure and achieve the same result robustly, provided the success path uses `break`.",
          "conceptual_gap": "While logically sound for this particular implementation (due to the manual termination `i=n`), the structure is overly complex because the loop control variable update (`i++`) is performed inside the `else` block (lines 25-27) instead of happening unconditionally either at the end of the loop or utilizing a `for` loop structure.
