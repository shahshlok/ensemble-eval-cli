          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that the inner loop of the Bubble Sort (lines 20-30) should run up to the second-to-last element (`j < n - 1 - i` or `j <= n - 2 - i`) to safely compare `scores[j]` and `scores[j+1]` without going out of bounds, effectively implementing a traditional bubble sort optimization where already sorted elements are ignored. However, they stop the outer loop condition at `n-1` (line 19) and the inner loop condition also at `n-1` minus the outer loop index, which, while technically correct for boundary checks *if* the loops were zero-indexed up to `n`, fails to produce a fully sorted array because the outer loop boundary is incorrect.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student implemented the standard Bubble Sort inner loop condition correctly for comparing `j` and `j+1` (`for (int j = 0; j < n - 1 - i; j++)`). However, the necessary condition for the outer loop (`for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++)`) only guarantees *n-1* passes, which is correct. The primary flaw here is not in the boundary handling of the sort logic itself, but rather that the problem requires finding the highest score, which implicitly means the array must be sorted in ascending order. If the sort logic were robust, the final result would only be incorrect if the array access was flawed.",

Their core logic for identification is sound based on sorting ascendingly and pulling the last element. The error is that their sorting routine fails to fully sort the data, leaving the top student (Bob, 92) in the wrong position.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student's implementation of Bubble Sort is correct in terms of direction (ascending). If the sort algorithm were executed correctly, accessing `names[n-1]` and `scores[n-1]` would correctly retrieve the highest score. The manifestation of the incorrect result ('Top student: Charlie (85)') is primarily a symptom of the incomplete sort caused by the preceding structural errors in the sort algorithm implementation, rather than a misinterpretation of sorting direction.",
