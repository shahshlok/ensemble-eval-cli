This suggests a fear that direct assignment might somehow corrupt or prematurely read the source value from the array structure during the process.",
          "conceptual_gap": "Java guarantees that the right-hand side of an assignment is fully evaluated before the assignment to the left-hand side occurs. Since `numbers[i-1]` and `numbers[i]` refer to distinct memory locations, the direct assignment `numbers[i] = numbers[i-1];` is entirely safe and sufficient. The temporary variable `temp` serves no purpose for maintaining correctness in this context, revealing an overly cautious mental model regarding sequential memory access and array structures.",

          "conceptual_gap": "The student has an overly complicated mental model of variable assignment in a loop. Assignment is a simple overwrite operation (numbers[i] = numbers[i-1]). The use of a temporary variable (temp) to hold numbers[i-1] serves no purpose because numbers[i-1] itself is not being overwritten until the next iteration of the loop (where 'i' decreases). This redundant variable makes the code unnecessarily complex but does not inherently cause a logical error in this specific implementation, unlike a common error where the element *numbers[i]* is stored in `temp` instead of *numbers[i-1]*. This appears to be a stylistic or efficiency misconception rather than a structural logic error causing an incorrect output.",
