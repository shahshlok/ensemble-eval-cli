          "conceptual_gap": "The student introduces a redundant check (`if (n != 0)`) before the search loop. While harmless in this particular successful implementation, it indicates a lack of understanding regarding how array instantiation and loop bounds automatically handle the zero-size case. If `n=0`, `int[] numbers = new int[0];` is valid, and the subsequent loop `for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)` would correctly not execute, meaning `foundIndex` remains -1 without needing the explicit `if` check.",

This leads to treating the required output for not found cases as a literal string/number '-1' printed directly, rather than potentially standardizing output formatting.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The prompt asks to 'Print the index... If T is not found, print -1.' The student implements this using two separate `System.out.println` statements depending on the result. While functionally correct for the specific output requirements, separating the printing logic (`System.out.println(\"Found at index: \" + foundIndex);` vs. `System.out.println(\"-1\");`) means the student misses the opportunity to standardize output if the required formats were similar (e.g., if both required just the number). This structure shows a rigid adherence to textual output requirements rather than clean flow control based on data type and availability.",
