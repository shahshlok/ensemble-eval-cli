This suggests a fear that accessing arr[i-1] and assigning to arr[i] in a single step might lead to data corruption or an unintentional side effect, confusing this simple copy operation with a more complex sequence, like a swap, where a temporary variable is truly necessary.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, the evaluation of the Right-Hand Side expression (`arr[i-1]`) is completed entirely before the assignment to the Left-Hand Side (`arr[i]`) takes place. The source element `arr[i-1]` is not modified by the assignment `arr[i] = ...`. Therefore, introducing an intermediate scoped variable `temp` (Lines 27-28) is functionally identical and computationally unnecessary compared to the direct efficient assignment `arr[i] = arr[i-1];`.",

          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that by initializing a loop to copy elements from `i-1` to `i`, and setting the temporary variable `temp = arr[i - 1]` inside the loop, they are ensuring that the original value of `arr[i-1]` is preserved before it is overwritten by `arr[i]` in the previous iteration. This suggests a misunderstanding of how the iteration order affects sequential updates in an array shift operation.",
          "conceptual_gap": "When shifting elements $arr[i] = arr[i-1]$ starting from the right ($i = n-1$ down to $i=1$), the value of $arr[i-1]$ is only needed once before $arr[i]$ is set. The previous iteration correctly set $arr[i-1]$. By introducing `int temp = arr[i - 1];` on line 21, the student copies the element that was *already shifted* into position, resulting in repeated values. For a correct shift, the value $arr[i-1]$ must come from the original, unshifted array state, or the copy operations must be done carefully to ensure the source index is retrieving the correct element for the target index, often resulting in $arr[i] = arr[i-1]$ without an unnecessary temporary variable that updates inside the loop.",
