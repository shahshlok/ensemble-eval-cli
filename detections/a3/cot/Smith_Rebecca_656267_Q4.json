This might stem from an overgeneralization of the 'use a temporary variable' rule necessary for swapping elements, or a lack of trust in Java's direct primitive value assignment mechanism.",
          "conceptual_gap": "For primitive types in Java, assignment (e.g., `a = b`) performs a direct copy of the value. When shifting elements in an array from right to left (`integerArray[i] = integerArray[i-1]`), direct assignment is sufficient and safer (in terms of local scope management). Introducing `temporaryHolder` is functionally redundant and complicates the loop body unnecessarily because `integerArray[shiftIndex - 1]` is not modified before its value is used for `integerArray[shiftIndex]`, and the subsequent loop iterations use the decremented index.",
