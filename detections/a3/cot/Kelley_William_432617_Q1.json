          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that using `break` inside an `if` condition within a loop that iterates through all elements guarantees finding the *first* occurrence correctly, primarily because they initialize the result variable (`index`) before the loop. The student seems to have implemented the logic correctly regarding using `break` to exit the loop immediately upon finding a match, but they failed to realize that the `index` must be preserved immediately upon the first success, and that subsequent iterations (if the `break` was missed or misapplied elsewhere) could cause overwriting, even though in this specific code, the `break` is correctly placed and functions as intended for finding the *first* match.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student code correctly implements the necessary logic for finding the first occurrence by initializing `index = -1`, iterating from `i = 0`, and using `break` immediately upon finding a match. Therefore, there is no conceptual gap related to finding the *first* occurrence in the provided implementation. The code exactly matches the required behavior.",
