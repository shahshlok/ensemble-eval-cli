This shows you can write a syntactically correct Java program using input, arithmetic, and output.\n- Areas for improvement: Carefully re-read the problem and ensure your program\u2019s behavior matches the exact specification: read 5 integers, use a loop to process them, check each for evenness with `n % 2 == 0`, accumulate the sum of the even ones, and print that sum.
