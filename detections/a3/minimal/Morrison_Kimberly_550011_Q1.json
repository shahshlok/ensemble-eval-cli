          "description": "The student implemented a physics-style average-acceleration calculator instead of a program that reads 5 integers and sums only the even ones. There is no code to read exactly 5 integers, no loop, no even-number test, and no accumulator for an even-number sum.\n\nRubric scoring for this question:\n- Reading 5 integers from input: 0/1. The program reads three doubles (v0, v1, t) instead of five integers.\n- Loop structure to process inputs: 0/1. There is no loop; the code reads a fixed number of values directly.\n- Conditional check for even numbers (n % 2 == 0): 0/1. There is no modulus or evenness check anywhere.\n- Accumulating sum and printing result: 0/1. The program computes (v1 - v0) / t and prints an acceleration, not the sum of even numbers.\n\nOverall feedback:\n- Strengths: You can correctly use Scanner to read input, store values in variables, perform arithmetic, and use a conditional operator to avoid division by zero. The code is syntactically correct and would run for its intended (different) task.\n- Areas for improvement: For this assignment, you must carefully align your code with the exact problem statement. Here, you needed to (1) read 5 integers, (2) use a loop to process them, (3) check each number with n % 2 == 0, (4) accumulate the sum of the even ones, and (5) print the correct label and result. Before coding, restate the problem in your own words and design the algorithm step by step so you do not accidentally solve a different exercise.",

Avoid copying or reusing code from unrelated problems, even if it compiles.\n\nConcrete fix steps for this question:\n- Change the prompt to something like 'Enter 5 integers:'.\n- Use int instead of double for the numbers.\n- Introduce a loop (for or while) that runs 5 times to read the 5 integers.\n- Inside the loop, use if (n % 2 == 0) to decide whether to add to the sum.\n- Replace the acceleration calculation and output with printing the sum of evens.\n\nOverall feedback:\n- You already know how to use Scanner and basic arithmetic; build on that by learning to design a solution from the problem text.\n- Practice a few small problems where you must use a loop plus an if-condition and an accumulator variable, so this pattern becomes automatic.",
