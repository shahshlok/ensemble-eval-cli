          "description": "The student implemented a distance-between-points calculator rather than a grade-to-letter-grade mapping program. As a result, none of the rubric requirements for Q3 are addressed: there is no numeric grade input (0\u2013100), no conditional logic to check ranges for A/B/C/D, no default handling for F, and no letter grade output. In rubric terms, this earns 0/1 for reading numeric grade input, 0/1 for correct Boolean ranges for A and B, 0/1 for correct Boolean ranges for C and D, 0/1 for correct handling of F, and 0/1 for mapping each range to correct letter output (total 0/5).",

It should then print the corresponding letter grade, matching the sample run.",

This suggests a misunderstanding of the importance of matching program behavior exactly to the problem description and rubric.",
          "remediation_hint": "Before coding, reread the problem and sample run and list the exact inputs, processing steps, and outputs required. For Q3, start a fresh class whose main method: (1) prints 'Enter grade: ', (2) reads a single numeric grade (e.g., an int) from the keyboard, (3) uses an if/else-if/else chain to test the grade against the ranges 90\u2013100, 80\u201389, 70\u201379, 60\u201369, and below 60, and (4) prints 'Letter grade: ' followed by 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', or 'F'.

          "correct_understanding": "The assignment requires reading a single numeric grade (0-100) and output a letter grade (A/B/C/D/F) based on specific ranges. The program should use conditional logic (if/else) to determine the appropriate letter grade and display it.",
