          "description": "The student has written a complete and mostly correct program for computing the area of a triangle from three points using Heron's formula, but this does not address Q4 at all. Q4 requires reading a single integer height N and printing a right triangle of asterisks with 1 to N stars per line. There is no code related to reading N, no loops for rows/columns, and no star pattern printing.\n\nRubric scores for this submission (Q4):\n- Reading height N from input: 0/1 \u2014 The program never reads an integer height; it reads six doubles for (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3) instead.\n- Outer loop handling N rows: 0/1 \u2014 There is no loop that iterates over triangle rows; the program does only a fixed sequence of input and arithmetic.\n- Inner loop for printing stars: 0/2 \u2014 No inner loop exists; the program does not print any repeated characters or patterns.\n- Correct pattern (1 star to N stars): 0/1 \u2014 The output is a text prompt and a numeric area; no star triangle shape appears.\n- Newline after each row: 0/1 \u2014 There are no rows of asterisks at all, so row-by-row formatting is missing.\n\nOverall feedback:\n- Strengths: You demonstrate comfort with Scanner input, method decomposition (distanceBetweenPoints), use of Math.sqrt and Math.pow, and computing a geometric quantity (triangle area). This is solid Java and math work.\n- Areas for improvement: For this question, you needed to focus on the exact specification: read a single integer N, then use nested loops to print rows of '*', from 1 up to N on separate lines. Practice carefully matching your code to the problem statement, and specifically for pattern-printing problems, think in terms of (1) reading the size, (2) an outer loop for rows, and (3) an inner loop for the number of characters per row.",
