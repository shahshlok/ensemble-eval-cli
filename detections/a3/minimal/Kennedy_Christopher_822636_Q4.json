Re-read the problem statement and restate it in your own words to be sure you understand what is being asked.\n2. Change the input to read a single integer height N (e.g., `int n = input.nextInt();`) after prompting `Enter height:`.\n3. Use a loop for the rows, e.g., `for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) { ... }`.\n4. Inside that loop, use another loop to print `i` asterisks on the same line (e.g., `for (int j = 1; j <= i; j++) System.out.print(\"*\");`), then call `System.out.println();` to move to the next line.\n5. Remove the coordinate input and area computation code; they are for a different kind of triangle problem.\n\nOverall feedback:\n- Strengths: You correctly know how to use `Scanner` for input, declare variables, perform mathematical calculations (distance formula and Heron\u2019s formula), and print results. This shows comfort with basic Java syntax and arithmetic.\n- Areas for improvement: The main issue is matching your code to the exact problem requirements. Before coding, pause to plan: what inputs are required, what outputs should look like, and what control structures (like loops) are needed. For pattern-printing problems specifically, practice designing nested loops that control rows and columns of characters.",
