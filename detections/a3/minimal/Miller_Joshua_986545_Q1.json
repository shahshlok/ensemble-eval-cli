There is no loop over 5 values, no check for even numbers, and no accumulator for a sum. This indicates a misunderstanding that the code must closely match the problem specification.\n\nRubric scoring for this submission:\n- Reading 5 integers from input: 0/1 (reads 3 doubles, not 5 integers, and prompt is for v0, v1, t rather than 5 integers)\n- Loop structure to process inputs: 0/1 (no loop or repeated input at all)\n- Conditional check for even numbers (n % 2 == 0): 0/1 (no conditional or modulus operator used)\n- Accumulating sum and printing result: 0/1 (computes (V1 - V0) / T and prints \"The average acceleration is ...\" instead of summing even integers)\n\nOverall, the submitted program does not attempt the required sum-of-evens task.",

Here, Q1 specifically requires: (1) reading exactly 5 integers from the user, (2) using a loop or repeated input to process all 5 values, (3) checking each number with n % 2 == 0 to see if it is even, (4) accumulating the sum of the even numbers only, and (5) printing that sum in the required format, e.g., \"Sum of even numbers: 14\".

Double-check that your prompt and variable names refer to the current problem (5 integers and even numbers), not to a physics example.\n\nOverall feedback: Your current code compiles and uses Scanner correctly, but it solves a completely different problem. For future assignments, slow down and carefully match your code to the exact input, processing, and output the question describes. Once you do that, add a loop, an if-condition for even numbers, and a sum accumulator to implement the required behavior.",
