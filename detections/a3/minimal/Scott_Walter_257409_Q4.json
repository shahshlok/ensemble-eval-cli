          "description": "Instead of writing a program that reads an integer height N and prints a right triangle of asterisks with N rows, the student implemented a completely different problem: computing the area of a geometric triangle from three coordinate points using distance and Heron's formula. The submission does not read a height, does not use loops to print rows of '*', and its output format does not resemble the required star pattern.\n\nRubric scoring for this submission:\n- Reading height N from input (1.0): 0/1 \u2014 program reads six doubles as coordinates, not a single integer height N.\n- Outer loop handling N rows (1.0): 0/1 \u2014 there is no loop over rows; program only executes sequential statements.\n- Inner loop for printing stars (2.0): 0/2 \u2014 no inner loop and no logic to print a variable number of '*' characters per row.\n- Correct pattern (1.0): 0/1 \u2014 output is a numeric area message, not a 1-to-N star triangle pattern.\n- Newline after each row (1.0): 0/1 \u2014 there are no triangle rows printed, so row-by-row formatting does not exist.\n\nOverall feedback:\n- Strengths: You demonstrate solid Java basics: using Scanner to read input, defining and calling a helper method (distance), using arithmetic and Math.sqrt, and structuring a small program cleanly.\n- Areas for improvement: Carefully read what each question is asking. This one is about loops and pattern printing, not geometric area. Practice writing nested loops to generate text patterns (like triangles of '*') and ensure your class name and program behavior match the question description.",

For this question: read one integer height N using nextInt(), then use a for-loop from 1 to N to represent each row. Inside that loop, use another for-loop from 1 to the current row number to print that many '*' characters, then print a newline.\n\nConcrete outline:\n- Print: \"Enter height: \"\n- int n = input.nextInt();\n- for (int row = 1; row <= n; row++) {\n    for (int col = 1; col <= row; col++) {\n        System.out.print(\"*\");\n    }\n    System.out.println();\n  }\n\nAlso, keep your older triangle-area solution in a separate file for the appropriate question, and ensure that for pattern-printing tasks you focus on loops and character output rather than geometric formulas.\n\nRubric outcomes for this attempt:\n- Reading height N from input: 0/1\n- Outer loop handling N rows: 0/1\n- Inner loop for printing stars: 0/2\n- Correct pattern (1 star to N stars): 0/1\n- Newline after each row: 0/1",
