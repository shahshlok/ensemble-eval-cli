There is no logic for reading 5 integers, no loop over 5 values, no even-number check, and no summation.\n\nRubric scoring:\n- Reading 5 integers from input: 0/1\n  - The program reads 3 double values (v0, v1, t) rather than 5 integers, and the prompt does not mention 5 integers.\n- Loop structure to process inputs: 0/1\n  - There is no loop of any kind; the program performs a single calculation from 3 inputs.\n- Conditional check for even numbers (n % 2 == 0): 0/1\n  - There is no conditional or modulus operation; the program never distinguishes even from odd numbers.\n- Accumulating sum and printing result: 0/1\n  - There is no accumulator variable or sum of even numbers; the output is an average acceleration, not a sum. \n\nTotal: 0/4.\n\nOverall feedback (strengths and areas for improvement):\n- Strengths:\n  - You correctly used the Scanner class to read input from the user.\n  - Your arithmetic expression for computing average acceleration is syntactically and logically correct for that separate physics problem.\n- Areas for improvement:\n  - Carefully align your program with the exact problem statement. For this question, you needed to read 5 integers, use a loop to process them, check each with n % 2 == 0, and accumulate the sum of the even ones.\n  - Practice translating English problem descriptions into code structure: identify the number of inputs, whether repetition is needed (loop), what condition filters data (even check), and what final result must be printed.",
