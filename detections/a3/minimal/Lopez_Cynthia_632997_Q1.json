          "description": "The submitted program solves a physics-style average acceleration problem (using v0, v1, and t as doubles) instead of the specified task of reading 5 integers and printing the sum of the even numbers. The prompt, variables, data types, and formula all correspond to a different exercise, so none of the rubric requirements for this question are actually addressed.\n\nRubric scoring for this submission:\n- Reading 5 integers from input (1.0 pt): 0/1 \u2014 Program reads three doubles (v0, v1, t) instead of five integers, and the prompt does not match the assignment.\n- Loop structure to process inputs (1.0 pt): 0/1 \u2014 No loop is used; inputs are read once each with nextDouble().\n- Conditional check for even numbers (n % 2 == 0) (1.0 pt): 0/1 \u2014 No conditional logic exists; there is no check for even numbers.\n- Accumulating sum and printing result (1.0 pt): 0/1 \u2014 No accumulator variable or sum of even numbers is computed; output reports an average acceleration instead of the required sum.\n\nOverall feedback:\n- Strengths: The student correctly uses Scanner to read input and performs a numeric calculation with appropriate use of double and arithmetic. The code is syntactically correct and will run.\n- Areas for improvement: The main issue is not addressing the problem statement at all. For future tasks, the student should carefully translate the English description into a concrete plan (read 5 integers, loop 5 times, check evenness with n % 2 == 0, accumulate sum, then print) before coding. Reusing code from other exercises without adapting it to the current specification leads to zero credit, even if the reused code is technically correct for some other problem.",

          "correct_understanding": "For this problem, the program must: (1) read exactly 5 integers from the user, (2) use a loop to process these 5 inputs, (3) use a conditional like if (n % 2 == 0) to select only even numbers, (4) maintain a running sum of those even numbers, and (5) print the final sum in the required format (e.g., \"Sum of even numbers: 14\"). Any program that does something else, such as computing average acceleration, does not meet the specification even if it is otherwise correct Java.",

This reflects a conceptual gap in mapping problem requirements into a program design: the student appears to focus on producing any working code rather than code that matches the exact task description (reading 5 integers, checking evenness, and summing).",
          "remediation_hint": "First, re-read the problem statement and restate it in your own words: \"Read 5 integers, add up only the even ones, and print the sum.\" Then design the algorithm step by step before coding:\n1) Declare an int variable sum = 0.\n2) Use a loop that runs 5 times (for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)) and in each iteration read an int from the user.\n3) Inside the loop, use if (n % 2 == 0) to check if the number is even; if it is, add it to sum.\n4) After the loop, print \"Sum of even numbers: \" + sum.\nReplace the current physics-specific code (v0, v1, t, and average acceleration) with this logic. As you work on future problems, practice translating the English requirements into a numbered list of steps before touching the keyboard, so you ensure your program directly addresses the assignment.\n\nOverall improvement focus:\n- Always align your variable names, prompts, and logic with the current problem statement.\n- Practice designing small algorithms with loops and conditionals for tasks like \"read N values and process some of them.\"",
