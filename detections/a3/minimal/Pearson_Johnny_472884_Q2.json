          "name": "Implemented a different problem instead of the required number guessing game",
          "description": "The student has written a complete and mostly correct solution for a road-trip cost calculator, but Q2 explicitly asks for a number guessing game where the computer picks a random number (1\u2013100) and the user guesses until correct with \"Too high\"/\"Too low\" hints. None of the required game behavior (random number generation, integer guess input, comparison logic, guess loop, or success message with guess count) is present, so the submitted program does not address the specification for Q2 at all.",
          "severity": "critical",
          "category": "procedural",
          "student_belief": "I can answer Q2 by writing a program that asks for driving distance, miles per gallon, and fuel price, then outputs the cost of a road trip. That will be treated as a valid solution for this question.",
          "correct_understanding": "For Q2 you must implement a number guessing game, not a road-trip cost calculator. The program should:\n- Use `Random rand = new Random(); int answer = rand.nextInt(100) + 1;` to pick a secret number between 1 and 100.\n- Repeatedly prompt the user to guess the number (using a loop).\n- After each incorrect guess, print either \"Too high!\" or \"Too low!\" depending on the guess.\n- Stop when the user guesses correctly and report how many guesses were taken.",

            "No conditional logic that compares a guess to a secret number or prints \"Too high\" / \"Too low\".",
            "No termination condition based on a correct guess or a guess counter; the program simply computes and prints trip cost once."
          ],
          "root_cause": "Most likely the student mixed up questions or reused code from a different assignment (a road-trip cost calculator) and submitted it for Q2. This suggests difficulty in carefully matching the written problem specification to the program they implement, rather than a misunderstanding of Java syntax itself.",
          "remediation_hint": "Re-read the Q2 specification line by line and check that each requirement appears in your code.\n\nConcretely, to fix this submission for Q2:\n1. Replace the road-trip prompts and `double` inputs with a prompt like `Guess a number (1-100):` and read an `int` guess.\n2. Create a `Random` object and an `int answer = rand.nextInt(100) + 1;` at the start of `main`.\n3. Use a `while` loop that continues until the user guesses the correct number.\n4. Inside the loop, compare the guess to `answer` and print `\"Too high!\"` or `\"Too low!\"` as appropriate.\n5. Keep a counter of how many guesses the user has made, and when the guess is correct, print `\"Correct! You took X guesses.\"` and exit the loop.\n\nRubric scoring for this submission (Q2):\n- Generating random number (1-100): 0/1 \u2013 no `Random` object or secret number is generated.\n- Loop for guessing (while/do-while): 0/1 \u2013 there is no guess loop; only input-validation loops for doubles.\n- Logic for \"Too high\" hint: 0/1 \u2013 no comparison of a guess to a secret number, no \"Too high\" output.\n- Logic for \"Too low\" hint: 0/1 \u2013 no \"Too low\" output or related logic.\n- Specific termination condition (correct guess): 0/1 \u2013 program never checks for a correct guess or reports guesses taken.\nTotal: 0/5.\n\nOverall feedback: Your Java syntax, input validation, and arithmetic for the road-trip problem are solid, which shows good understanding of `Scanner` and basic expressions. However, it's crucial to ensure that the program you submit actually matches the problem statement. For future questions, start by listing the required behaviors from the specification (random answer, guess loop, hints, termination) and then check that each one is reflected in your code before submitting.",
