Change the input to read a single numeric grade, e.g.:\n   - Prompt: \"Enter grade: \"\n   - Use one variable (int or double) for the grade, not x1, y1, etc.\n2.

Test your program with several sample inputs (e.g., 95, 85, 75, 65, 50) and confirm the outputs match the specification.\n\nOverall feedback:\n- Strength: You demonstrate that you can use Scanner to read numeric input and perform arithmetic with variables and Math.sqrt.\n- Main improvement area: Carefully match your program to the exact problem description.
