Change the prompt and input to read a single numeric grade (e.g., `int grade = input_scanner.nextInt();`).\n2. Add an if/else-if/else chain to check the ranges, for example:\n   - if (grade >= 90) \u2192 print \"A\"\n   - else if (grade >= 80) \u2192 print \"B\"\n   - else if (grade >= 70) \u2192 print \"C\"\n   - else if (grade >= 60) \u2192 print \"D\"\n   - else \u2192 print \"F\"\n3. Update the output message to match the sample: `Letter grade: B` (or A/C/D/F accordingly).\n\nOverall feedback:\n- Strengths: Your distance program is syntactically correct, uses `Scanner` properly, and shows good variable naming and use of `Math.sqrt`. This is solid Java work for that separate task.\n- Areas for improvement: Always ensure your code directly matches the question. Before coding, restate the requirements in your own words and sketch the needed inputs, processing steps, and outputs.
