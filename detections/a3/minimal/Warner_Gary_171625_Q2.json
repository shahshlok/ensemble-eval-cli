Using `=` in an `if` condition in Java 21+ throws a compile-time error, or in older C/C++ style compilation, evaluates to the assigned value (which is likely non-boolean and causes errors/warnings). This specific usage in Java results in a compilation error because int cannot be converted to boolean.",
