For this question, that means: read 5 integers, check each for evenness with `n % 2 == 0`, keep a running sum of the even ones, then print the final sum.\n  * Use a loop (`for` or `while`) to avoid repeating input code five times. Inside the loop, read one integer, test if it is even, and if so add it to `sum`.\n  * Make sure your prompts and variable names match the problem (e.g., `\"Enter 5 integers: \"`, variables like `number` and `sum`), so you stay focused on the correct task.\n  * Before submitting, compare your program\u2019s behavior with the sample run to confirm that it matches the required input and output format.\n\nTo fix this specific problem:\n1. Change the prompt to `\"Enter 5 integers: \"`.\n2. Use `int` instead of `double` for the inputs.\n3. Use a loop that runs 5 times and reads an integer each iteration.\n4. Inside the loop, use `if (n % 2 == 0)` to test for even numbers and add to `sum`.\n5. After the loop, print `\"Sum of even numbers: \" + sum`.",
