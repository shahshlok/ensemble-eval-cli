Here, the program should: (1) read 5 integers from the user, (2) check each one to see if it is even (n % 2 == 0), (3) accumulate the sum of only the even numbers, and (4) print that sum. Any solution that instead solves a different problem (such as average acceleration) is incorrect, even if it compiles and runs.",

Then implement these steps in Java using a loop, an if-statement, and an accumulator variable.\n\nOverall feedback: Your current code shows that you can declare variables, read input with Scanner, and perform arithmetic on them, which are good foundational skills.
