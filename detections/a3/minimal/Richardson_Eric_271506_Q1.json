Input handling:\n   - Read 5 integers (int), not 3 doubles.\n   - You can use a loop (for or while) that runs 5 times and calls nextInt() each time.\n\n2. Loop structure:\n   - Use a loop like: for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) { ... }\n   - Inside the loop, read one integer from the user on each iteration.\n\n3. Even check and sum:\n   - For each input number n, check if it is even with: if (n % 2 == 0) { ... }.\n   - Maintain a sum variable (e.g., int sum = 0;). When the number is even, add it to sum.\n\n4. Output:\n   - After the loop completes, print: \"Sum of even numbers: \" followed by the sum.\n\nRubric-based scoring for your current code (for your awareness):\n- Reading 5 integers from input (1.0 point): 0/1 \u2014 reads 3 doubles instead of 5 integers.\n- Loop structure to process inputs (1.0 point): 0/1 \u2014 no loop or equivalent repeated input.\n- Conditional check for even numbers (1.0 point): 0/1 \u2014 no use of n % 2 == 0 or any even check.\n- Accumulating sum and printing result (1.0 point): 0/1 \u2014 computes average acceleration, not sum of even numbers.\n\nStrengths:\n- You correctly imported java.util.* and used Scanner, which shows you know how to read input.\n\nNext steps:\n- Practice reading problem statements slowly and checking that each requirement (number of inputs, types, operations, and required output format) is explicitly present in your code before you consider the solution finished.",
