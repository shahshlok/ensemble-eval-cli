          "description": "The student implemented a 'RoadTripCostCalculator' that computes driving cost from distance, MPG, and fuel price, instead of the required number guessing game. As a result, there is no random number between 1 and 100, no loop allowing multiple guesses, no 'Too high'/'Too low' feedback, and no termination condition based on guessing the secret number.\n\nRubric scoring:\n- Generating random number (1-100): 0/1 \u2014 No use of Random or any random number generation; the program only reads three doubles and performs a cost calculation.\n- Loop for guessing (while/do-while): 0/1 \u2014 There is no loop; the program runs a single, straight-line computation and then exits.\n- Logic for \"Too high\" hint: 0/1 \u2014 No comparison of a guess to a secret number, so no 'Too high' message.\n- Logic for \"Too low\" hint: 0/1 \u2014 No comparison of a guess to a secret number, so no 'Too low' message.\n- Specific termination condition (correct guess): 0/1 \u2014 Program termination is unrelated to a correct guess; it simply ends after printing the cost once.\n\nOverall feedback:\nStrengths:\n- You correctly use Scanner to read numeric input from the user.\n- You perform an appropriate arithmetic calculation and output a readable result. This shows comfort with variables, expressions, and basic I/O.\n\nAreas for improvement:\n- For this question, you needed to implement a number guessing game with random number generation, a loop that keeps asking until the correct guess, and conditional 'Too high'/'Too low' messages.\n- Carefully re-read the problem specification before coding. Make a short checklist (random number, loop, hints, guess counter, termination) and ensure your code covers each item.\n- Practice small console games (guessing game, simple menus) to get comfortable with combining Random, loops, and if/else statements.",
