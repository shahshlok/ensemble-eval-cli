The program never reads a single numeric grade (0\u2013100), never uses conditionals to map ranges to letter grades, and its prompts and output do not match the specification.\n\nRubric scoring:\n- Reading numeric grade input (1.0): 0.0/1.0 \u2014 The program prompts for x1, y1, x2, y2 and reads four doubles instead of a single grade between 0 and 100.\n- Correct Boolean ranges for A and B (1.0): 0.0/1.0 \u2014 There are no if/else or Boolean conditions at all; grade ranges are not checked.\n- Correct Boolean ranges for C and D (1.0): 0.0/1.0 \u2014 Same issue; no middle-grade range checks are implemented.\n- Correct handling of F (default/else) (1.0): 0.0/1.0 \u2014 There is no default/else logic; failing grades are not handled.\n- Mapping each range to correct letter output (1.0): 0.0/1.0 \u2014 The program prints a numeric distance instead of a letter grade like A, B, C, D, or F.\n\nTotal: 0.0/5.0 for this question.",
