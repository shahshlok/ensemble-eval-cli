          "description": "The student wrote a program that calculates the distance between two points rather than a grade-to-letter-grade calculator as specified. Instead of reading a single numeric grade in the range 0-100 and mapping it to A/B/C/D/F using conditional ranges, the program reads four doubles (x1, y1, x2, y2) and computes a Euclidean distance.\n\nRubric scoring:\n- Reading numeric grade input (1.0/1.0): 0.0 points. The program does not read a single grade value; it reads four coordinate values instead.\n- Correct Boolean ranges for A and B (1.0/1.0): 0.0 points. There are no conditional checks for grade ranges; no logic for A or B.\n- Correct Boolean ranges for C and D (1.0/1.0): 0.0 points. No conditions for C or D either.\n- Correct handling of F (default/else) (1.0/1.0): 0.0 points. There is no 'else' or default case for grades below 60.\n- Mapping each range to correct letter output (1.0/1.0): 0.0 points. The program outputs a distance value instead of a letter grade.\n\nOverall feedback:\n- Strengths: You correctly use Scanner to read input values, store them in appropriately typed variables (double), perform arithmetic computations, and use Math.sqrt to compute a distance. Your code is well-commented and logically structured for the distance problem.\n- Areas for improvement: For this question, you needed to implement a different problem: read a single numeric grade (0-100) and use if/else if/else statements to print the correct letter grade. Carefully re-read each problem before coding, and ensure that your program's input prompts, variables, and output all match the specification. Practice writing simple if/else chains that check numeric ranges and print the corresponding labels.",
