Your current code solves a different physics-related problem.\n  * Use a loop (for or while) to read 5 integers and process each one in turn.\n  * Use an if condition with n % 2 == 0 to decide whether each input is even before adding it to the sum.\n  * Keep printing separate from calculations: update sum with numeric values, then print the final sum with a clear message like \"Sum of even numbers: \" + sum.",
