(2) Store it in a variable of a suitable numeric type. (3) Use an if/else-if/else chain to test whether the grade is in 90\u2013100, 80\u201389, 70\u201379, 60\u201369, or below 60. (4) Print the corresponding letter (A, B, C, D, F) exactly as required. Remove the distance formula and any coordinate-related prompts or variables.\n\nRubric scoring:\n- Reading numeric grade input: 0/1 \u2013 The program reads four doubles (x1, y1, x2, y2) and never reads a single grade value.\n- Correct Boolean ranges for A and B: 0/1 \u2013 There are no conditional checks for any grade ranges.\n- Correct Boolean ranges for C and D: 0/1 \u2013 No conditional logic is present at all.\n- Correct handling of F (default/else): 0/1 \u2013 No else/default case or F handling is implemented.\n- Mapping each range to correct letter output: 0/1 \u2013 The program outputs a numeric distance, not a letter grade.\n\nOverall feedback:\nStrengths: Your code compiles and runs, uses Scanner correctly to read input, and correctly applies the distance formula with Math.sqrt and multiplication. That shows you can work with variables, arithmetic expressions, and basic I/O.\nAreas for improvement: For this specific question, the main issue is that the program does not address the required task at all. Focus on translating the problem statement into program behavior: identify required inputs, the decisions you must make (grade ranges), and the exact outputs expected. Practice writing simple if/else chains to map numeric ranges to category labels like letter grades.",
