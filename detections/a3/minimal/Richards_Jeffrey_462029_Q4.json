This indicates a misunderstanding of the problem requirements (confusing this task with a different 'triangle area' problem).\n\nRubric scoring for Q4:\n- Reading height N from input: 0/1 (reads six doubles for coordinates instead of a single height value)\n- Outer loop handling N rows: 0/1 (no loop over rows of the triangle)\n- Inner loop for printing stars: 0/2 (no inner loop or repeated printing of '*')\n- Correct pattern (1 star to N stars): 0/1 (does not attempt to print any star pattern)\n- Newline after each row: 0/1 (no rows of the shape; only a final line with the numeric area)\n\nTotal: 0/6.",
