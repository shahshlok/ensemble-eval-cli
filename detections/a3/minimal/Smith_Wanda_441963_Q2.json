          "description": "The student implemented a road trip cost calculator instead of the required number guessing game for Q2. The program asks for driving distance, miles per gallon, and fuel price, then computes a trip cost. It never generates a random number, never prompts the user to guess, and never gives 'too high'/'too low' feedback or stops when the correct guess is entered.\n\nRubric scoring for Q2 based on this submission:\n- Generating random number (1-100): 0/1 \u2014 No use of Random, no secret number between 1 and 100 is generated.\n- Loop for guessing (while/do-while): 0/1 \u2014 No loop or repeated guessing logic; the program just reads three inputs once and exits.\n- Logic for 'Too high' hint: 0/1 \u2014 No comparison between a guess and a secret number, so no 'too high' feedback.\n- Logic for 'Too low' hint: 0/1 \u2014 No comparison between a guess and a secret number, so no 'too low' feedback.\n- Specific termination condition (correct guess): 0/1 \u2014 Program does not have any concept of a correct guess or a game-ending condition tied to guessing the right number.\n\nOverall feedback:\nStrengths: The code the student wrote is syntactically correct, uses Scanner correctly to read numeric input, performs a reasonable arithmetic computation, and prints a clear result. This shows basic comfort with variables, expressions, and console I/O.\nAreas for improvement: For this question, the core issue is not following the problem specification. Before coding, they should map each requirement in the prompt to concrete steps in code: generating a random answer, setting up a loop that repeats until the guess is correct, comparing the guess to the answer to print 'too high' or 'too low', counting guesses, and finally printing the success message. Reviewing how to translate problem statements into program structure (state, loops, and conditionals) will help them build the correct game next time.",

          "student_belief": "I can answer this question by writing any valid Java program that solves some problem (in this case, computing road trip cost), rather than specifically implementing the described number guessing game with random numbers, repeated guesses, and high/low hints.",
          "correct_understanding": "For each question, the program must directly implement the behavior described in the problem statement. In this case, the program needs to: (1) generate a random secret number between 1 and 100, (2) repeatedly prompt the user to guess, (3) after each incorrect guess, indicate whether it is too high or too low, and (4) stop only when the guess is correct and report how many guesses were taken.",

          "remediation_hint": "Before coding, list the required behaviors from the problem statement and make sure each one appears in your design and code. For this game, you should: (1) create a Random object and generate an int between 1 and 100; (2) use a while or do-while loop that keeps asking for guesses until the user gets the correct number; (3) inside the loop, compare the guess to the secret number and print either 'Too high!' or 'Too low!' when incorrect; (4) count how many guesses have been made; and (5) when the guess is correct, print the 'Correct!' message and the guess count.
