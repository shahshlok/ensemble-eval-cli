          "correct_understanding": "For each question, the program must directly implement the behavior described in that question\u2019s specification. Here, the program must: (1) generate a random integer between 1 and 100, (2) repeatedly prompt the user to guess until they are correct, (3) after each wrong guess, tell the user whether the guess was too high or too low, and (4) terminate only when the correct number is guessed, reporting how many guesses were taken.",

This suggests difficulty in translating a problem specification into an appropriate algorithm and control flow, rather than issues with basic syntax.",
          "remediation_hint": "You need to rewrite this program so that it matches the number guessing game description rather than calculating trip cost.\n\nConcretely:\n1. Set up the game state:\n   - Import java.util.Random.\n   - Create a Random object and generate the secret number: `Random rand = new Random(); int answer = rand.nextInt(100) + 1;`.\n2. Use a loop for repeated guesses:\n   - Use a `while` or `do-while` loop that keeps asking the user for guesses until they guess `answer` correctly.\n   - Maintain a counter for how many guesses the user has taken.\n3. Provide feedback on each guess:\n   - If `guess > answer`, print \"Too high!\".\n   - If `guess < answer`, print \"Too low!\".\n4. Terminate on correct guess:\n   - When `guess == answer`, exit the loop and print a message like `\"Correct! You took X guesses.\"`.\n\nRubric scoring for this submission:\n- Generating random number (1-100): 0/1 \u2014 No use of `Random` or any random number; no secret answer between 1 and 100 is created.\n- Loop for guessing (while/do-while): 0/1 \u2014 The program runs once, reads three numeric inputs, and ends; there is no loop over user guesses.\n- Logic for \"Too high\" hint: 0/1 \u2014 There is no user guess or comparison to an answer, so no way to output \"Too high\".\n- Logic for \"Too low\" hint: 0/1 \u2014 Similarly, no comparison or 'Too low' output is present.\n- Specific termination condition (correct guess): 0/1 \u2014 The program does not check for a correct guess; it always terminates after computing and printing the trip cost.\n\nOverall feedback:\n- Strengths: Your code is syntactically correct, uses `Scanner` properly to read user input, and performs arithmetic and printing without errors. This shows you are comfortable with basic Java syntax, variables, and console I/O.\n- Areas for improvement: Carefully read each problem and ensure your program behavior matches the specification exactly. For this question, you must implement a number guessing game, which requires random number generation, loops, and conditional logic for feedback. Practice taking the English description of a program, identifying the needed constructs (randomness, loops, conditionals, termination condition), and designing your code around those requirements.",
