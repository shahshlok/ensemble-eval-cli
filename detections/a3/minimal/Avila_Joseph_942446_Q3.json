          "correct_understanding": "For this question, the program should read one numeric grade (0\u2013100) from the user, use conditional logic (if/else-if/else) to determine which grade range it falls into (A: 90\u2013100, B: 80\u201389, C: 70\u201379, D: 60\u201369, F: below 60), and then print the corresponding letter grade in the format shown in the sample run (e.g., \"Letter grade: B\").

          "remediation_hint": "Stop and compare your code directly to the problem statement and sample run.\n\nFor this question, you should:\n1. Read a single numeric grade (probably an int) from the user using Scanner.\n   - Prompt: \"Enter grade: \"\n   - Example: int grade = input.nextInt();\n2. Use an if/else-if/else chain to test which range the grade falls into:\n   - if (grade >= 90 && grade <= 100) {\n         letter = 'A';\n     } else if (grade >= 80) { ... } etc.\n3. Print the result as: \"Letter grade: \" followed by the correct letter.\n4. Do not include any code about x1, y1, x2, y2, dx, dy, or distances. That belongs to a different problem.\n\nRubric-wise, this current solution would earn 0/5 because:\n- Reading numeric grade input (1 pt): No single grade is read; instead four coordinates are read.\n- Correct Boolean ranges for A and B (1 pt): No Boolean conditions or ranges for grades.\n- Correct Boolean ranges for C and D (1 pt): Same issue; no conditional checks.\n- Correct handling of F (default/else) (1 pt): No else/default for out-of-range or failing grades.\n- Mapping each range to correct letter output (1 pt): No letter grades printed at all.\n\nRewrite the program from scratch with the grade calculator requirements in front of you, and after coding, run through the sample input (85) to verify that you get: \"Letter grade: B\".",
