Change the prompt to something like \"Enter 5 integers: \".\n2. Use an int sum = 0; variable as an accumulator.\n3. Use a loop (for or while) that runs 5 times. In each iteration:\n   - Read an int from the user.\n   - If the number is even (n % 2 == 0), add it to sum.\n4. After the loop, print \"Sum of even numbers: \" + sum.\n\nOverall feedback (strengths and areas for improvement):\n- Strengths: You correctly used Scanner to read input and performed an arithmetic calculation, which shows you understand basic input and expressions.\n- Areas for improvement: Focus carefully on the problem statement and ensure your code matches the required inputs, logic (loops and conditionals), and output. Practice translating English descriptions into step-by-step algorithms before you start coding.",
