As a result, none of the rubric\u2019s required behaviors (reading 5 integers, using a loop, checking evenness, accumulating a sum of evens) are present.\n\nRubric scoring:\n- Reading 5 integers from input: 0/1 \u2014 The program reads three doubles (v0, v1, t) instead of five integers.\n- Loop structure to process inputs: 0/1 \u2014 There is no loop; the code reads a fixed number of values without iteration.\n- Conditional check for even numbers (n % 2 == 0): 0/1 \u2014 No conditional logic is used to filter even numbers.\n- Accumulating sum and printing result: 0/1 \u2014 The program computes an acceleration value and prints it instead of summing even integers.\n\nOverall feedback:\nStrengths: The student correctly uses Scanner to read numeric input and performs a basic arithmetic computation, then prints a result. This shows they can structure a simple Java program and work with variables and expressions.\nAreas for improvement: Carefully read the problem statement and ensure the code matches the required behavior: read exactly 5 integers, use a loop to process them, check each for evenness with n % 2 == 0, accumulate the sum of even numbers only, and finally print that sum.",
