          "description": "The student appears to have misunderstood the problem entirely. Instead of writing a program to read a height N and print a right triangle pattern using asterisks, the student wrote a program that calculates the area of a triangle from three coordinate points using Heron's formula.",

The solution requires: (1) Scanner to read one integer N, (2) nested loops (outer for rows 1 to N, inner for asterisks 1 to current_row), (3) System.out.print('*') in the inner loop.
