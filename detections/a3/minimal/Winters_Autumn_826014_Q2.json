This indicates a misunderstanding that the assignment requires a specific behavior and game loop, not just any program that uses input and arithmetic.\n\nRubric scoring for this submission:\n- Generating random number (1-100): 0/1 \u2014 No use of Random or any random number generation; there is no secret number between 1 and 100.\n- Loop for guessing (while/do-while): 0/1 \u2014 No loop for repeated guesses; the program only reads three numeric inputs once (distance, mpg, price).\n- Logic for \"Too high\" hint: 0/1 \u2014 No conditional comparisons between a guess and a secret number; therefore, no \"Too high\" message.\n- Logic for \"Too low\" hint: 0/1 \u2014 Similarly, no \"Too low\" logic or output.\n- Specific termination condition (correct guess): 0/1 \u2014 The program does not terminate based on the user guessing correctly; it simply computes and prints a cost and exits.\n\nTotal: 0/5 on the provided rubric for Q2.",

In this case, the program must implement a number guessing game: the computer randomly chooses a number from 1 to 100, repeatedly prompts the user to guess, prints \"Too high\" or \"Too low\" for incorrect guesses, and ends only when the user guesses correctly, reporting the number of guesses taken.",

          "remediation_hint": "First, re-read the problem statement carefully and restate it in your own words to ensure you understand the required behavior.\n\nTo fix this program for Q2:\n1. Change the program so it models a number guessing game instead of a road trip cost.\n2. Import java.util.Random and create a Random object: `Random rand = new Random();`.\n3. Generate the secret number with `int answer = rand.nextInt(100) + 1;`.\n4. Use a loop (while or do-while) that keeps asking the user for a guess until the guess equals `answer`.\n5. Inside the loop, use if/else-if/else to compare the guess to `answer` and print \"Too high!\" or \"Too low!\" as appropriate.\n6. Keep track of how many guesses the user has made and, when the correct guess occurs, print a message like the sample: `Correct! You took X guesses.`.\n\nOverall feedback:\n- Strengths: You correctly use Scanner to read doubles, perform arithmetic with variables, and print a formatted result. The code is clear and well-structured for the road trip problem.\n- Areas for improvement: Focus on carefully matching your program to the exact problem description. Before coding, outline the required inputs, outputs, and control flow (random number, loop, conditionals). Then implement that design rather than reusing unrelated code from other exercises.",
