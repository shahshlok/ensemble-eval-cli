Re-read Q2 and implement a number guessing game that:\n  * Uses Random to pick an int from 1 to 100 (e.g., `Random rand = new Random(); int answer = rand.nextInt(100) + 1;`).\n  * Uses a loop (while or do-while) to repeatedly prompt the user to guess until they are correct.\n  * After each wrong guess, prints 'Too high!' or 'Too low!' depending on the guess relative to `answer`.\n  * Counts how many guesses the user took and prints that when they finally guess correctly.\nMake sure the file you submit for Q2 contains that game logic, not code for a different exercise.",
