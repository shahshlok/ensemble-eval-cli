The code is logically structured and would be appropriate for a different kind of triangle problem.\nAreas for improvement: For this question, you needed to write a much simpler program: read one integer N and use nested loops to print a right triangle of '*' characters from 1 to N per row. In future, double-check that your solution matches the exact problem statement (question number, required input/output format).
