          "description": "The student has fundamentally misunderstood the problem. They wrote code to calculate the area of a triangle given three coordinate points using Heron's formula, rather than printing a right triangle pattern given a single height value.",
          "severity": "critical",
          "category": "conceptual",
          "student_belief": "The student appears to believe the problem requires reading three coordinate pairs (x1,y1), (x2,y2), (x3,y3) and calculating the area of the triangle they form, likely confusing this problem with a different question or misreading the problem statement.",
          "correct_understanding": "The problem requires reading a single integer N representing the height, then printing N rows where row i contains i asterisks, forming a right triangle pattern. For example, height 4 produces 4 rows with 1, 2, 3, and 4 asterisks respectively.",

          "remediation_hint": "Carefully re-read the problem statement.
