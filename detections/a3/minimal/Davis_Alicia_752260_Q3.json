          "remediation_hint": "Rewrite your solution to follow the exact specification for the grade calculator problem:\n1. Input: Use Scanner to read ONE numeric grade (int or double) between 0 and 100. For example: `System.out.print(\"Enter grade: \"); int grade = input.nextInt();`\n2. Processing: Use an if/else-if/else chain to check the grade against the required ranges:\n   - 90\u2013100: A\n   - 80\u201389: B\n   - 70\u201379: C\n   - 60\u201369: D\n   - below 60: F\n3. Output: Print the corresponding letter grade, matching the format: `Letter grade: B`.\n\nWhen you get a problem, first write down:\n- What is the input? (here: one number 0\u2013100)\n- What processing/logic is needed? (here: compare the number to ranges)\n- What output is required? (here: a letter A\u2013F in the specified format)\nThen check that your program does exactly those steps and nothing unrelated.\n\nStrengths: You correctly use Scanner to read numeric input and perform arithmetic with doubles. These are good skills.\nAreas for improvement: Focus on carefully reading each problem statement, making sure your inputs, conditionals, and output text all match what is asked before moving on.",
