          "name": "Wrong Problem Submitted",
          "description": "The student has submitted a complete solution to a different problem (distance between two points) rather than the assigned grade calculator problem. This indicates either a fundamental misunderstanding of the assignment requirements or accidental submission of incorrect code.",
          "severity": "critical",
          "category": "conceptual",
          "student_belief": "The student appears to believe this code solves the grade calculator problem, or submitted without verifying they were solving the correct task.",
          "correct_understanding": "The assignment requires reading a single numeric grade (0-100) and outputting the corresponding letter grade (A/B/C/D/F) based on specified ranges. The code must include conditional logic (if/else) to check which range the grade falls into.",

            "Output is a distance value instead of a letter grade",
            "No conditional logic for grade ranges present"

          "root_cause": "Student likely submitted the wrong file, copy-pasted incorrect code, or did not read the problem statement carefully before beginning.",
          "remediation_hint": "Start fresh: carefully re-read the problem statement. Your program should: (1) read ONE integer/double representing a grade, (2) use if-else statements to check which range it falls into, (3) print the corresponding single letter (A, B, C, D, or F).",
