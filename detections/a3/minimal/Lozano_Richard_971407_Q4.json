          "description": "The student implemented a program to compute the area of a geometric triangle from three coordinate points instead of printing a right triangle made of asterisks with N rows. This indicates a misunderstanding of the problem requirements for Q4.\n\nAs a result, none of the rubric requirements for the star pattern are met:\n- Reading height N from input (0/1): The program reads six double values (x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3) instead of a single integer height N.\n- Outer loop handling N rows (0/1): There is no loop that iterates over rows from 1 to N.\n- Inner loop for printing stars (0/2): There is no inner loop and no use of '*' characters to form a pattern.\n- Correct pattern (1 star to N stars) (0/1): The output is a numeric area value, not a right triangle of stars.\n- Newline after each row (0/1): The program prints only prompts and a single line with the area; it does not print multiple rows of a pattern.\n\nOverall feedback:\nStrengths:\n- Correct and idiomatic use of Scanner to read numeric input.\n- Correct use of double variables and Math.sqrt to compute distances and area (Heron\u2019s formula).\n- The code is syntactically correct and likely runs without errors for its chosen task.\n\nAreas for improvement:\n- Carefully match your code to the exact problem statement. Here, Q4 asked for a text-based star pattern controlled by a height N, but your solution computes a triangle\u2019s area from coordinates.\n- For pattern-printing problems, practice using nested loops: an outer loop for each row, and an inner loop to print the correct number of '*' characters per row.\n- Use the sample run as a checklist: your program\u2019s prompts, inputs, and outputs should closely resemble the example (e.g., \"Enter height:\", lines of '*').",
