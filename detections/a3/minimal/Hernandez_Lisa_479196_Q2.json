          "remediation_hint": "Re-read the problem statement carefully and design your program around those exact requirements before coding.\n\nFor this question, you need to:\n1. Create a Random object and generate a secret number: `Random rand = new Random(); int answer = rand.nextInt(100) + 1;`\n2. Use a loop (while or do-while) to repeatedly:\n   - Prompt: `Guess a number (1-100): `\n   - Read the user's guess.\n   - Compare the guess to `answer` and print `Too high!` or `Too low!` when incorrect.\n3. Keep a counter of how many guesses the user has made.\n4. When the user guesses correctly, exit the loop and print: `Correct! You took X guesses.`\n\nRubric scoring for this question:\n- Generating random number (1-100): 0/1 \u2013 Program does not generate any random number or use the Random class.\n- Loop for guessing (while/do-while): 0/1 \u2013 No loop for repeated guessing; program runs once and exits after computing cost.\n- Logic for \"Too high\" hint: 0/1 \u2013 No comparison between a guess and a secret number; no 'Too high' message.\n- Logic for \"Too low\" hint: 0/1 \u2013 No comparison between a guess and a secret number; no 'Too low' message.\n- Specific termination condition (correct guess): 0/1 \u2013 Program does not have a notion of a correct guess or a termination based on it.\n\nOverall feedback:\nStrengths:\n- You correctly use Scanner to read user input and store it in appropriately typed variables.\n- Your arithmetic for computing fuel cost (`distance / mpg * price`) is logically correct for the road trip problem.\n- You include debug print statements, which shows awareness of testing and inspecting intermediate values.\n\nAreas for improvement:\n- The most important issue is solving the wrong problem. Always double-check that your program matches the exact behavior described in the question (inputs, outputs, and control flow).\n- Practice translating a plain-English specification into a program plan (variables needed, control structures, and output format) before writing code.\n- For this specific question, focus on random number generation, loops for repeated guessing, and if/else comparisons to give feedback ('Too high'/'Too low') and stop on a correct guess.",
