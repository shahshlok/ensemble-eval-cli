Outer loop handling N rows: 0/1 (no loop over rows is present). Inner loop for printing stars: 0/2 (no logic to print asterisks, and no nested loops).

Newline after each row: 0/1 (no rows of stars are printed; only a single line of numeric output).\nOverall feedback (strengths and areas for improvement): Strengths: You correctly use Scanner to read doubles and use Math.sqrt and Math.pow to compute side lengths and area, which shows good comfort with expressions and library methods. Areas for improvement: Carefully reread the problem statement and restate the required input and output in your own words before coding.
