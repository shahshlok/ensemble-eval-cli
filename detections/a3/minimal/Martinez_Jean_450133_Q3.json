Change the input to read a single numeric grade (e.g., an int or double) with a prompt like \"Enter grade: \".\n2. Use an if/else-if/else chain to test the grade against the required ranges:\n   - if grade >= 90\n   - else if grade >= 80\n   - else if grade >= 70\n   - else if grade >= 60\n   - else (this is F)\n3. For each range, print the correct output format, e.g., \"Letter grade: A\".\n4. Remove all code related to x1, y1, x2, y2, and distance computation; that belongs to a different problem.\n\nOverall feedback:\n- Strengths: You correctly use Scanner to read numeric input and you correctly apply a distance formula using Math.sqrt, which shows comfort with basic Java syntax and math operations.\n- Areas for improvement: Focus on reading the problem description carefully and ensuring your program\u2019s inputs, processing, and outputs all align with the specification.
