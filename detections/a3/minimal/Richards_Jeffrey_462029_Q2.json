          "description": "The student\u2019s program solves a road-trip cost calculator instead of the specified number guessing game. It never generates a random number, never prompts the user to guess, and does not give \"Too high\" / \"Too low\" feedback or count guesses.\n\nRubric scoring:\n- Generating random number (1-100): 0/1 \u2014 no Random object or random number between 1 and 100.\n- Loop for guessing (while/do-while): 0/1 \u2014 program runs once, no guessing loop.\n- Logic for \"Too high\" hint: 0/1 \u2014 no comparisons between guess and secret number.\n- Logic for \"Too low\" hint: 0/1 \u2014 same as above.\n- Specific termination condition (correct guess): 0/1 \u2014 program terminates after one calculation, not based on a correct guess.\n\nOverall feedback: You wrote a syntactically correct Java program that reads user input and performs arithmetic, which is good practice, but it does not address the number guessing game described in the question. For this problem, you need to (1) generate a random integer between 1 and 100, (2) repeatedly ask the user to guess, and (3) give \"Too high\" / \"Too low\" hints until they guess correctly, then report how many guesses it took.",
