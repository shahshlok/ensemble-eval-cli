          "remediation_hint": "Rubric scoring for this submission:\n- Reading 5 integers from input (1.0 pt): 0.0/1.0\n  The program reads 3 double values (v0, v1, t) instead of 5 integers, and the prompt text does not match the problem.\n\n- Loop structure to process inputs (1.0 pt): 0.0/1.0\n  There is no loop; the program does not iterate over 5 values. All inputs are read individually and only three values are read.\n\n- Conditional check for even numbers (n % 2 == 0) (1.0 pt): 0.0/1.0\n  The code never checks whether a number is even and never uses the modulo operator.\n\n- Accumulating sum and printing result (1.0 pt): 0.0/1.0\n  The program computes an average acceleration instead of a sum of even numbers, and the printed message is unrelated to the required output.\n\nHow to fix your program for Q1:\n1. Change the prompt and input types:\n   - Use an int variable for each number, or an int inside a loop.\n   - Example prompt: \"Enter 5 integers: \".\n2. Use a loop to read exactly 5 integers:\n   - For example, use a for loop that runs 5 times.\n3. Inside the loop, test each number for evenness:\n   - Use if (n % 2 == 0) to check if the current number is even.\n4. Maintain an accumulator for the sum of even numbers:\n   - Start with int sum = 0; and add the number to sum only if it is even.\n5. After the loop, print the result in the required format:\n   - System.out.println(\"Sum of even numbers: \" + sum);\n\nOverall feedback:\n- Strengths: You know how to use Scanner to read input and how to perform arithmetic and print a result. This shows basic comfort with Java syntax and I/O.\n- Areas for improvement: Focus on carefully reading each problem and designing a new solution that matches its exact requirements, rather than reusing unrelated code. Practice problems where you (a) identify how many inputs are needed and of which type, (b) decide whether a loop is required, and (c) use conditionals and accumulators to compute the desired result.",
