It never reads 5 integers, never uses a loop, and never checks for even numbers.\n\nRubric scoring:\n- Reading 5 integers from input: 0/1 \u2014 The program reads exactly three values (v0, v1, t) as doubles, not five integers.\n- Loop structure to process inputs: 0/1 \u2014 There is no loop; inputs are read one by one with separate nextDouble() calls.\n- Conditional check for even numbers (n % 2 == 0): 0/1 \u2014 There is no conditional logic related to even numbers or the % operator.\n- Accumulating sum and printing result: 0/1 \u2014 The program computes a single formula (average acceleration) instead of accumulating a sum of even values, and the printed message is about acceleration, not the sum of even numbers.",

Write down the steps in plain English: read 5 integers, check if each is even, keep a running sum, then print the sum.\n2.

For this question, you need to practice using a loop to read a fixed number of integers, conditionals with n % 2 == 0 to find even numbers, and an accumulator variable to keep a running sum.
