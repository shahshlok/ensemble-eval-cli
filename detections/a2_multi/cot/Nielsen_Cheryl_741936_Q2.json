Also, a, b, and c are local to the loop body and are recreated each iteration (they do not \u201cremember\u201d values between iterations); only totalNumberOfGuesses persists across iterations.\n\nTrace (illustrative run): Suppose secretAnswerValue=62 and inputs are 50, 75, 62.\n- Start: totalNumberOfGuesses=0, userGuessValue=0.\n- Iter1 read 50; a=0,b=1,c=1 => totalNumberOfGuesses=1; prints Too low.\n- Iter2 read 75; a=1,b=1,c=2 => totalNumberOfGuesses=2; prints Too high.\n- Iter3 read 62; a=2,b=1,c=3 => totalNumberOfGuesses=3; prints Correct! ... 3 guesses.\nSo there is no behavioral divergence here; the issue is conceptual/style (mental model of update).",
