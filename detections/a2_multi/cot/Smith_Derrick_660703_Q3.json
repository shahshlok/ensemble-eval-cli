They think that writing `grade_input >= b && grade_input <= 89` will correctly identify grades in the B range (80-89), without realizing that once a higher category (A: 90+) has already been checked and rejected, the upper bound check is redundant or creates logical errors.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student does not fully understand that in a cascading if-else chain, once a condition is evaluated and found false, all subsequent conditions are only checked for inputs that failed all previous conditions. By including explicit upper bounds in each condition (like `<= 89` for B), the student is creating redundant checks that don't improve correctness and may reflect a misunderstanding of how the control flow works. More critically, the student fails to recognize that for an input like 85, the first condition `grade_input >= a && grade_input <= 100` (90-100) is false, so the code correctly moves to the next condition. However, the structure suggests the student thought each condition needed to independently verify both bounds, rather than understanding that the if-else chain already eliminates higher values.",
          "error_manifestation": "The code will actually produce correct output for most inputs (e.g., 85 correctly yields 'B'), but this is due to the cascading nature of if-else chains masking the logical redundancy rather than the student's intended clarity.
