They lack a mental model for structures like the do-while loop or infinite loops with internal break conditions, leading them to use 'magic number' sentinels that are outside the game's valid range (1-100) simply to force initial entry into the loop body.",

If the condition becomes false halfway through the loop body (e.g., when userGuess is updated), execution continues until the end of the block before checking the condition again.",
