They think that without this check, a grade of 85 might incorrectly match the A condition if grade >= 90 is somehow satisfied.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student does not fully understand how if-else chains work. Once a condition is true and its branch executes, subsequent else-if conditions are not evaluated. The explicit check 'grade <= 100' in the first condition is logically redundant because the second else-if condition 'grade >= b (80)' will only be reached if 'grade >= a (90)' was false. The upper bound check does not cause incorrect behavior here, but it reflects incomplete understanding of control flow\u2014the student may believe they need to explicitly constrain ranges even when the logical structure of the if-else chain already handles this through short-circuiting.",

They declared variables for all lower-bound thresholds (a=90, b=80, c=70, d=60) but hardcoded the upper bound (100) directly in the condition. This inconsistency suggests they do not fully appreciate the principle of DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) or the benefit of named constants for readability and maintainability. A complete mental model would recognize that all magic numbers\u2014including 100\u2014should be defined as named variables or constants.",
