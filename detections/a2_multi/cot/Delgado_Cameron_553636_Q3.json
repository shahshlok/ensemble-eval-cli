          "conceptual_gap": "In Java's sequential control flow, the 'else' part of an 'if-else if' structure is only reached if all previous conditions were false. For example, if 'grade >= 90' is false, the computer already knows 'grade < 90'. Re-verifying this in the next branch (e.g., 'grade <= 89') is computationally redundant and demonstrates a lack of understanding of the notional machine's ability to maintain logical state across a conditional chain.",
          "error_manifestation": "The code becomes overly verbose and difficult to maintain. Additionally, if the data type were shifted from an integer to a floating-point number, these discrete integer-bound checks (e.g., stopping at 89) would create logical gaps where values like 89.5 are not captured.",
