The expression `currentRowStars + \"*\"` creates a *new* String object containing the combined characters, and then the assignment `=` makes `currentRowStars` refer to that new object.

In a small one-shot program like this, it\u2019s usually fine, but in larger programs (or multi-part exercises, tests, or environments where other code needs input later), closing `System.in` can cause later reads to fail (e.g., `NoSuchElementException`/`IllegalStateException`).
