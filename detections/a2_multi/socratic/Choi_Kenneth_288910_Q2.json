          "conceptual_gap": "There isn\u2019t an obvious gap here: the code\u2019s control flow and state updates match Java\u2019s execution model. The random number is generated once, the guess variable is updated only when `nextInt()` runs, and the loop terminates based on the current value of `x` compared to `n`. This reflects a correct mental model of variables, loops, and comparisons.",
