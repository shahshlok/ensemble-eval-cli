          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, variables should ideally be declared in the narrowest scope possible (e.g., inside the for-loop header). Declaring loop counters at the method level makes them persist after the loop finishes, which can lead to bugs in larger programs where variable names might be reused accidentally.",

          "conceptual_gap": "While 1-based loops work for simple print statements, they diverge from Java's internal logic where sequences (arrays, lists, strings) start at index 0. This mental model often leads to off-by-one errors when the student begins working with data structures.",
