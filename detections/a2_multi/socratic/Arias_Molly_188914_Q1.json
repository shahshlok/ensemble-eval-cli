          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, while local variables must be initialized before being read, they do not need to be initialized at declaration if their first use is an assignment (like s.nextInt()). Redundant initialization can mask bugs where a variable is accidentally used before its intended value is set.",

          "conceptual_gap": "Java's expression evaluation allows for complex nesting. Logical steps like checking parity and choosing a value can be combined directly into a single statement or an 'if' condition without manually managing intermediate states in memory variables like 'b' and 'c'.",
