          "conceptual_gap": "In Java and most zero-indexed languages, the standard mental model for loops is to count from 0 up to N-1 using the 'exclusive' boundary (<). While starting at 1 with an 'inclusive' boundary (<=) works for this display logic, it differs from the way the notional machine handles data structures like arrays or strings, where starting at 1 would cause an 'off-by-one' error by skipping the first element.",
