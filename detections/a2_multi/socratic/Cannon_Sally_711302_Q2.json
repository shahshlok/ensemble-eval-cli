          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that when the guess is correct, the program should not print either \"Too low!\" or \"Too high!\", and that the loop will end cleanly without needing a special \"Correct\" branch inside the loop.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, the body of a `while` loop runs to completion for the current iteration once the condition was true at the start of that iteration. The condition (`b != a`) is only checked again at the top of the *next* iteration. So if the user enters the correct guess, the loop iteration still finishes (including the `if/else if` checks), and only then does control return to the `while` condition and terminate. This student\u2019s code actually handles this correctly by not printing anything on equality, but many beginners incorrectly expect the loop to stop 'immediately' mid-iteration. The code suggests the student may be relying on that intuition rather than explicitly reasoning about the order of execution.",
          "error_manifestation": "No error here\u2014this is a potential mental-model fragility: if they later added an `else` expecting it to run only on incorrect guesses, they could accidentally print on the correct guess. As written, it works, but it may be based on a slightly shaky execution-order model.",
