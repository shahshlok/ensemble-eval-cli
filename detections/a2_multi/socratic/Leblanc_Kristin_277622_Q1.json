They may also believe `x` is some ongoing \u201cevenness state\u201d that must be updated each time before the `if`.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, expressions like `(a % 2 == 0)` can be evaluated directly inside the `if` condition. Assigning `a % 2` to `x` is not wrong, but it suggests the student may not yet see that an `if` condition can contain a full boolean expression and that `%` already produces the needed value for the comparison. The notional machine issue here is understanding that the computer evaluates expressions at the moment they are used; you don\u2019t need an intermediate variable unless you want it for readability or reuse.",
