However, they then hardcode the upper bounds directly in the conditions (100, 89, 79, 69) instead of using the variables or recognizing that each boundary should be the upper limit of the previous tier.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student has correctly identified that bounds should be stored in variables for readability, but failed to follow through consistently. More critically, they don't recognize that the upper bound in each condition should logically be one less than the lower bound of the next tier. This suggests a gap between understanding the problem domain (grade ranges) and translating it into conditional logic. The hardcoded values suggest the student is treating each condition as an isolated case rather than part of a hierarchical chain.",
          "error_manifestation": "The code will produce correct output for most inputs because the hardcoded boundaries (100, 89, 79, 69) happen to align with the problem requirements.
