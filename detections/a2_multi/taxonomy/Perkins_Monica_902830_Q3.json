Within that block, the programmer can rely on the fact that the condition is true\u2014there is no need to redundantly re-check the same bounds. The final else-if statement (line 49) checks (numericGradeInput >= 0 && numericGradeInput < 60) even though we already know from the outer if that numericGradeInput >= 0. This is logically harmless but demonstrates a misunderstanding of how conditional nesting simplifies verification.",
