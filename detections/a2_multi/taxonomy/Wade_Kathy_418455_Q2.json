          "conceptual_gap": "In the Java execution model, the condition of a while loop is only evaluated at the start of each iteration. Once the execution enters the loop body, it will execute every statement in the block sequentially until the end is reached, regardless of whether the condition has become false mid-block.",

However, if the code had printed feedback before updating the count, the final count might have been incorrect under a different logic.",
