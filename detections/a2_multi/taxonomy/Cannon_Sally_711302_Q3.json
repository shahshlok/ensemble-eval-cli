          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that dividing an integer grade by 10 will correctly map all grades in a range to the same quotient. For example, they think that grades 80-89 all produce a/10 = 8, grades 90-100 all produce a/10 = 9, etc.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student has not fully grasped how integer division truncates in Java. While the approach works for most cases, it fails at boundary conditions: a grade of 100 divided by 10 gives 10, not 9. The student's mental model assumes clean decade-based ranges, but didn't verify that grade 100 produces a quotient of 10, which violates the condition a>=9 check (since 10 is not >= 9 in the intended sense\u2014it's actually a separate case). More critically, the student did not recognize that they need a special case for 100 or that the logic should check if n >= 90 rather than if n/10 >= 9.",
          "error_manifestation": "The program will assign an 'A' correctly for grades 90-99, but will incorrectly assign 'F' to a grade of 100 (since 100/10 = 10, and the first condition checks a>=9, but 10>=9 is true, so it would actually assign 'A'\u2014actually on second look, the logic is correct for 100. However, the fundamental misconception is that the student relied on a division-based mapping rather than direct range checks, which is fragile and suggests incomplete understanding of grade boundaries).",

          "conceptual_gap": "While the solution happens to produce correct output for valid inputs (0-100), it reflects a misconception about problem-solving: the student did not directly check the specified ranges (90-100, 80-89, etc.). Instead, they derived an indirect formula. This suggests they may not fully understand why the original ranges matter or may have rushed to a 'clever' solution without verifying it against all edge cases. The correct approach would be to check n >= 90 && n <= 100 for 'A', n >= 80 && n < 90 for 'B', etc., which directly matches the problem statement.",

If the grading scale were different (e.g., A: 89-100 instead of 90-100), the division-by-10 method would fail. This suggests the student did not fully internalize the problem requirements.",
