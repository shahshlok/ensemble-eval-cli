However, they don't recognize that hardcoding the upper bounds (100, 89, 79, 69) in the same conditionals breaks the abstraction they created.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student has a partial understanding of variable abstraction. While they correctly extract lower bounds into variables, they fail to recognize that the upper bounds should also be parameterized or that the boundary conditions should be consistent. In reality, the variables a, b, c, d are used for lower bounds, but the upper bounds are hardcoded with slightly different values (89 instead of b-1, 79 instead of c-1, 69 instead of d-1), creating an inconsistent and error-prone pattern. The student may believe that 'using variables' is sufficient for good practice without understanding the deeper principle of consistent parameterization.",
          "error_manifestation": "The code will compile and run, producing correct output for test cases near the boundaries, but the inconsistency between the parameterized lower bounds and hardcoded upper bounds suggests the student doesn't fully understand the grading scale logic.
