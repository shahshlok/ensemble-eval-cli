          "conceptual_gap": "The problem statement describes a domain (0\u2013100), but Java will happily accept any integer from `nextInt()`. If the user enters values outside 0\u2013100 (e.g., 105 or -3), the current logic will still assign a letter grade (e.g., 105 becomes 'B'), which violates the intended mapping if out-of-range inputs are possible. This is a requirements/logic gap rather than a Java syntax/semantics issue.",

          "conceptual_gap": "In the Java execution model, an 'else if' branch is evaluated if the entire preceding condition is false. If a grade is 105, the condition 'grade >= 90 && grade <= 100' is false because of the upper-bound check. The program then evaluates the next branch 'else if (grade >= 80)', which evaluates to true for 105, resulting in an incorrect letter grade. The student fails to realize that failing a specific part of a compound condition in a chain does not prevent the value from being matched by broader conditions further down the chain.",
