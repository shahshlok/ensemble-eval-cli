          "conceptual_gap": "The student fails to recognize the sequential narrowing of the possibility space in Java's control flow. In an if-else if chain, the 'else' branch is only reached if all prior conditions are false, making upper-bound re-verification (like checking <= 89 after checking >= 90) redundant. Similarly, they do not recognize that constraints established by an outer 'if' block remain in effect for all inner code.",
