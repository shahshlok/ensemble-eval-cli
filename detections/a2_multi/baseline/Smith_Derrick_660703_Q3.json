They think that writing `grade_input >= b && grade_input <= 89` correctly checks if a grade falls in the B range (80-89), without realizing that this creates logical inconsistencies and redundancy.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student does not fully understand that once a condition fails in an if-else chain, subsequent conditions should implicitly assume the previous ranges have already been rejected. By hardcoding upper bounds (89, 79, 69) instead of relying on the structure of the if-else chain, the student creates brittle, redundant logic. More critically, they may not recognize that the lower bound variables (a=90, b=80, c=70, d=60) already encode the boundaries, making hardcoded upper bounds unnecessary and error-prone. The proper mental model is that in an if-else chain, once you check `>= 90`, the next check `>= 80` implicitly means 80-89 because 90+ was already handled.",
          "error_manifestation": "While this particular code happens to produce correct output due to the way the boundaries align, it demonstrates a flawed understanding of conditional logic structure.
