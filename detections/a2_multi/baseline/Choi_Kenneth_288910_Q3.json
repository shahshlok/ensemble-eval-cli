The condition should be `if(x>=65)` printing D and `else` printing F, but this only works for 60-64 range. For 65-69, it will incorrectly print D when the entire 60-69 range should print D. The student failed to recognize that `x>=60` already guarantees we're in the 60+ range, so checking `x>=65` creates a partition rather than a proper range check.",
