When they add 1, they get values from 1 to 100, which is correct. However, their intermediate step of storing 100 in variable 'a' and then using rand.nextInt(a) suggests they may have been confused about the correct parameter. The real issue is that while their final calculation (rand.nextInt(100) + 1) is accidentally correct, the logic path shows they may not fully understand why.",
