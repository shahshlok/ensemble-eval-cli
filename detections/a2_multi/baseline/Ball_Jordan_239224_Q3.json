          "conceptual_gap": "The problem statement asks to map a numeric grade (0\u2013100) to a letter grade; it does not specify behavior for invalid inputs. Clamping is a change to the program\u2019s required behavior: it silently transforms user input rather than handling it explicitly (e.g., rejecting it, reprompting, or documenting the assumption). This is not a Java execution misconception, but a specification/logic misunderstanding about what the program should do with invalid input.",
