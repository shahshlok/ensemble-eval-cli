They treat the assignment `int grade = numericGrade;` as a necessary step, when `numericGrade` could be used directly in the conditionals. More significantly, the logic for handling out-of-range grades (< 0 or > 100) assigns 'F' as the letter grade, which conflates input validation with the grading scale. The problem statement defines F as 'below 60' within the valid 0-100 range, not as a catch-all for invalid inputs. The nested if-else structure with explicit boundary checks (>= 0, <= 100) suggests the student views input validation and grade classification as intertwined concerns rather than separate logical steps.",
