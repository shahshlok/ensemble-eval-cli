          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, the `while` condition is evaluated at the top of each iteration. With this structure, the iteration where the user finally guesses correctly still executes fully (because the condition was true at the start of that iteration), so printing \u201cCorrect!\u201d inside the loop is acceptable. However, the student is mixing two competing termination strategies (loop-condition termination plus an internal correctness check), which often leads to off-by-one or duplicated output in similar problems and indicates a shaky model of when the condition is checked and when the loop stops. A clearer mental model is: either (a) loop forever and `break` on correct guess, or (b) structure the loop so the success message happens after the loop ends.",

However, the student has reversed the logic: they set `a = 100` and `b = 1`, then compute `rand.nextInt(a) + b`, which is correct by accident. But the conceptual understanding is flawed because the variable names and their usage suggest the student thinks `a` is the range size and `b` is the offset, when actually they should understand that `nextInt(n)` generates [0, n) and the offset shifts it. The real issue is that while the code happens to work, the mental model of how `nextInt()` operates is incomplete.",
