More fundamentally, the student seems to believe that modifying a mid-iteration will somehow 'control the next line,' when in reality, the modification just breaks the loop counter mechanism. The student lacks understanding that: (1) the for-loop's increment happens after each iteration regardless of manual modifications, (2) modifying loop variables mid-loop leads to unexpected termination or behavior, and (3) there is no mechanism by which modifying a affects 'how the next line will look' as stated in the comment.",

However, since a starts at 1 again, only one asterisk will be printed per row, and the loop will continue until a exceeds userInputHeight.
