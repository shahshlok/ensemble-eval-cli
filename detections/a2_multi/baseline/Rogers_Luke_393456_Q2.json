          "conceptual_gap": "In interactive programs, handling invalid input typically requires user feedback (e.g., an error message) and sometimes re-prompting logic that makes it clear why the input was rejected. Java will continue looping correctly here, but the user may perceive the program as doing nothing after entering invalid input because no message is printed. This is not a Java execution misunderstanding, but it is a common gap in understanding robust I/O behavior.",

Specifically, they think that calling `scanner.next()` to consume the bad input will allow the loop to proceed naturally to the next prompt.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student does not fully understand the control flow of while loops. When a non-integer is entered and `scanner.next()` consumes it, the loop immediately returns to the while condition check and re-enters the loop body, which immediately prints the prompt again without waiting for new input from the user. However, the real issue is that after consuming bad input with `scanner.next()`, the program goes back to the top of the while loop without giving the user another chance to provide input. The `guessCount` is only incremented on valid input, which is correct, but the bad input handling should include a `continue` statement or restructure the logic. More critically, when bad input occurs, the program will loop infinitely printing prompts because `scanner.hasNextInt()` will remain false for the same bad input still in the buffer (if nothing consumes it properly), or it will keep prompting without ever getting a valid guess recorded.",
