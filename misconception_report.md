## Legend: Formulas and Metrics

This section explains how each metric in the report is calculated:

### Executive Summary Tables

**Most Difficult Areas (by % of class affected)**

- **Topic**: The unique topic where misconceptions were detected
- **Total Misconceptions**: Total count of misconceptions flagged at this Topic
- **Students Affected**: Count and percentage of unique students with misconceptions at this Topic

  $$\text{Students Affected \%} = \frac{\text{unique students with misconceptions}}{\text{total students}} \times 100\%$$

- **Avg Confidence**: Average model confidence for misconceptions at this Topic

  $$\text{Avg Confidence} = \frac{\sum \text{confidence scores}}{\text{count(misconceptions)}}$$

Sorted by: Number of students affected (descending), then by total misconceptions (descending)

**Most Common Misconceptions**

- **Occurrences**: Number of times this specific misconception was detected across all students
- **Models Agreeing**: Number of different models that detected this misconception
  - Shows the specific model names that flagged it

### Model Agreement Analysis

- **Misconceptions Detected**: Total number of misconceptions each model identified across all students

### Confidence Scores

All confidence scores range from 0.0 to 1.0:

- **0.0 - 0.5**: Low confidence (uncertain/borderline misconception)
- **0.5 - 0.7**: Moderate confidence
- **0.7 - 0.9**: High confidence
- **0.9 - 1.0**: Very high confidence (strong evidence of misconception)
