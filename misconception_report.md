## Legend: Formulas and Metrics

This section explains how each metric in the report is calculated:

### Executive Summary Tables

**Most Difficult Areas (by % of class affected)**

- **Students Affected**: Count and percentage of students who had misconceptions for this Bloom Level + Task combination

  $$\text{Students Affected \%} = \frac{\text{students with misconceptions}}{\text{total students}} \times 100\%$$

- **Avg Confidence**: Average confidence score across all misconceptions in this category

  $$\text{Avg Confidence} = \frac{\sum \text{confidence scores}}{\text{count(misconceptions)}}$$

**Top Bloom Levels by Misconceptions**

- **Total Misconceptions**: Total count of misconceptions flagged at this Bloom's Taxonomy level
- **Students Affected**: Count and percentage of unique students with misconceptions at this Bloom level

  $$\text{Students Affected \%} = \frac{\text{unique students with misconceptions}}{\text{total students}} \times 100\%$$

- **Avg Confidence**: Average model confidence for misconceptions at this Bloom level

  $$\text{Avg Confidence} = \frac{\sum \text{confidence scores}}{\text{count(misconceptions)}}$$

**Most Common Misconceptions**

- **Occurrences**: Number of times this specific misconception was detected across all students
- **Models Agreeing**: Number of different models that detected this misconception
  - Shows the specific model names that flagged it

### Model Agreement Analysis

- **Misconceptions Detected**: Total number of misconceptions each model identified across all students

### Detailed Analysis by Bloom Level + Task

- **Students Affected**: Students who had misconceptions in this category

  $$\text{Students Affected \%} = \frac{\text{students with misconceptions}}{\text{total students}} \times 100\%$$

- **Total Misconceptions**: Total count of misconceptions in this category
- **Average Confidence**: Mean confidence score for misconceptions in this category

  $$\text{Avg Confidence} = \frac{\sum \text{confidence scores}}{\text{count(misconceptions)}}$$

- **Model Agreement Rate**: Proportion of models that agreed on misconceptions in this category

  $$\text{Model Agreement Rate} = \text{average}\left(\frac{\text{models detecting each misconception}}{\text{total models}}\right)$$

### Per-Student Summary

- **Total Misconceptions**: Count of all misconceptions flagged for this student across all models
- **Avg Model Confidence**: Average confidence across all misconceptions for this student

  $$\text{Avg Model Confidence} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} \text{confidence}_i}{n}$$

  where $n$ = count of misconceptions for the student

  - Higher values indicate models are more confident about the misconceptions they detected
- **Top Bloom Level**: The Bloom's Taxonomy level with the most misconceptions for this student

### Confidence Scores

All confidence scores range from 0.0 to 1.0:

- **0.0 - 0.5**: Low confidence (uncertain/borderline misconception)
- **0.5 - 0.7**: Moderate confidence
- **0.7 - 0.9**: High confidence
- **0.9 - 1.0**: Very high confidence (strong evidence of misconception)
